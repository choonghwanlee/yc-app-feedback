Sumer Application Video for YC S22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ISHGyuyhXM," Hi, I'm Oliver Giseka and I'm a research fellow at Stanford University and CEO of Finquest AI. I'm Iris Constantine, a high frequency trader at X3D Capital and Head of Sales. And hi, I'm Ananjitali. I'm a software engineer at Amazon and I'm CEO. You're building a search engine for financial data. We're doing it because financial analysts and consultants need to search for financial data on a daily basis. There is nothing comparable to Google to rely on, which makes the search very costly. And we're doing it now because recent innovations in embedding and semantic search modeling have allowed groups such as ours to come together and become the next great financial search engine. Our clients demand accuracy of hard data points like EBDA and sales, but they also require soft information for context. And that is what our product provides. We are seeking funding from Y-Combinator to reduce search costs across multiple professionals, including finance, legal and government."

SInC Benefits - Y Combinator Video Application (S18),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-64VAWVc4Y," Making sense of healthcare benefits in paying medical bills is a complete pain in the ass. Our company's SYNC benefits removes the frustration and confusion from that process. My name is Michael Hicks and I'm founder and CEO and this is my partner, Dinesh. Hi, I'm Dinesh Cambier and I'm the co-founder and CTO of SYNC benefits. SYNC is a mobile platform that automatically collects employees medical claims information, reconciles their payment responsibility and presents that information to them in a clear, easy to understand format. We then enable click-to-pay functionality that enables every employee to pay their medical bills with confidence from one simple integrated and convenient location. Once employees trust and rely upon the platform, we can then steer them to other high quality low-cost, digital health and wellness products and services that enables them and their employers to save massively on their healthcare benefits costs. We're looking to partner with Y Combinator to help us grow as quickly as possible. SYNC save done."
Zenefits (YC W2013) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S83fysRwn4," Hi, I'm Parker Conrad. I'm founder of Zenefits. Zenefits is a platform for small businesses to manage insurance and benefits, primarily health insurance. And one way to think about this is that we're trying to replicate or actually really improve on everything that a small group commercial insurance broker does for their clients. And that starts with sick integrations into payroll systems that lets us pull out all the key HR data about a company and its employees so that you don't have to sort of write out all that information in pencil on a form that's been faxed to you by your insurance broker. And then we integrate with all the insurance carriers so that we can get you instant quotes. And then if you enroll in a policy, we can log back into your payroll system and set up all the deductions correctly so that things go smoothly next time you run payroll. And what the end goal here is released that as a company founder or HR person or what have you, you never have to think about this again. It just works and you don't have to worry about it. And there are a couple of interesting things about this business. The first is that the state of technology and insurance industry is just woefully behind the times. And I truly believe that we can do a much better job. There's nothing that an insurance broker does that we can't do better in software because we can personalize advice to you and your situation and your employee situations rather than sort of speaking in generalities. But the second sort of interesting thing is that starting in 2014, commissions are going to start coming down on health insurance for insurance brokers as a result of provisions in Obama and the Obamacare legislation. And insurance brokers have been complaining for years that they don't make enough money on their small group clients. And so a lot of them are saying that starting in 2014, they're either going to stop working with small groups or they're going to start charging a per-member per month administration fee. So one of the really interesting things here is that I could be launching this product at a time when the wheels are really coming off the cart for the existing solutions in the marketplace. A bit about me and my background. Before this company, I was co-founder and head of product at SIGFIG, which is the world's largest online financial advisor by AUM, about $40 billion when I left the company. And there I managed the team that built our SIG integrations. So I have a lot of experience with building that stuff. We built it from scratch, which is obviously really useful for the current venture. And you maybe wonder if you're thinking yourself, well, where are the other co-founders? Are they sort of hiding sort of just out of frame here or something? And I am a solo founder right now, but I won't be for long. I have a non-recruit provision with my former company that lasts until the end of October. And there are like two or three real rockstar folks that I want to recruit into this latest company that I think all have a good chance of getting. And so hopefully by the time the product starts, this will be sort of a three or four person company instead of one person company today. Thanks! Bye!"
Trection - YC Application Video - Summer 2020,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOSAUAPueQ," Hi, I'm Maurice. I'm Arthur. And then Shell. Fashion is an automated tool that enables efficient trip planning for travelers. From booking flights and hotels to finding things to do can actually take a lot of time. If you take about 10 to 15 hours just to do that. For super thorough users it could even take 20 hours or longer. Our team believes that there has to be a better way to do this. By streamlining everything together on a single platform. The user is no longer has to visit multiple websites. I just for the flights, for the hotels, or even for the activities. Ultimately, these information could be automatically transformed into a night-tenary based on user preferences. What are you going to have your plan break down to hours or have it down in morning, afternoon and night? We got you. So I hope you find this video helpful and I hope to see you all at Y-Cominator and San Francisco over the summer. Thank you for your time."
HubSeq (YC Summer 2022 - Selected for Interview) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0MgUyCkzcs," Hi, my commentator. My name is Jerry and I am building a cloud-based genomics platform called HUBSEAK to automate the process of taking raw sequencing data and generating results. So I've worked in genomics for over 15 years now for many different companies and labs and I've seen the same problem over and over again, which is the process of taking raw sequencing data from an experiment and generating results is largely manual. So usually what happens is a team of biopharmatic scientists and data scientists get together and process and visualize all that data manually. So in the end, there's data on three different people's laptops, there's plots on four different people's laptops, as well as Google Drive and Dropbox, and it's a big mess. So what we're trying to build at HUBSEAK is a centralized platform to do all of that data processing and data visualization. So currently I have a beta prototype with some of the parts of that workflow done and you can demo it at demo.hubseak.com. I'm frantically working on a working prototype because I have several early customers who are interested in testing the product, a working version of the product. So yeah, I'm really excited. I have a lot of big plans for HUBSEAK and my goal is that every lab that does sequencing will be using this product. So hopefully I can be a part of Y Combinator this summer. Thank you."
YC Winter Application 2022 Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V85HzjyOYdc," Hey, YC, my name is Harry. I'm the co-founder and CEO of the Global Staff Shot. Well, I'm currently a high school senior at Toy School Soul, and I oversee marketing, operations, and partnership, and also fundraising at the Global Staff Shot. I'm Joe Zaram, the CTO at Global Snaps, and I'm a man at the University of Graduate. As per 2020 Gallup poll, there is a significant bias within media. So at TGS, we seek to utilize machine learning software to provide conservative and liberal viewpoints from a neutral perspective. So, just to highlight the two key metrics of the Global Staff Shot, first of all, our average open email rate is 43.7%, which is higher than the indices average, which is 15 to 20%. And also, our average click rate is 7%. Initially, we intend to develop an implement our machine learning software via freeware. However, as we're going to develop, we intend to utilize, we intend to develop our proprietary software that will then outsource to businesses and corporations."
Thalassa (YC W19) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwdOO3Pzbgc," Hi everyone, my name is Vish. I'm a former Earth Systems Scientist at NASA and I'm currently working on my startup called Velasa. Velasa combines ecological processes with technology and carbon offset markets to solve our global warming crisis. And we do this by creating engineered islands of special grasses that grow rapidly and sequester 100 kilograms of carbon annually per square meter. This means it only takes an engineered island half the size of San Francisco to sequester 5 million tons of carbon annually. And that today's current carbon offset prices that will generate 100 million dollars in annual recurring revenue. Now scale this out to a fleet of engineered islands whose aggregate surface area only accounts for 0.3% of the total surface area of the ocean and we've solved all of the world's climate problems for good."
Remade Founder Video - YC S24 Application (Accepted!),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_HIpz3pVRc," Hi, OSE, we're the co-founders of FITAI. My name is Chris, and I'm a computer engineering student at Cambridge, and a bank of America quant. I'm Rahan, I'm a Goldman Sachs engineer in Texas, I'm Malib, I'm a CS fund list and next founder, Alchemy Labex, which x did at 600k revenue. Hi, I'm Blendy, I did computer engineering, and I'm also the founder of a YouTube channel that I made when I was 14, and since then it's grown to around the million subscribers, and $200,000 in ad revenue. So during our time here at Cambridge University, we found it really annoying whenever we tried to order food online, and the Russian had no images. To investigate this further, we did a survey of around 80 food delivery platform users, and we found that a lot of them shared the same views as us. In fact, around one third of them have never ordered an item on a food delivery platform when there was no image of it. We interviewed delivery platforms in restaurants, and they realized that the reason why this could change is because food photography is expensive and time consuming. In fact, restaurants with images in delivery platforms have 35% more orders than other restaurants. And we decided to build a platform in which restaurants can upload around 10 to 15 smartphone images of their menu item, and then generate professional visuals based on their preferences related to content, style, and background. Our solution is around 50 times faster, and 100 times cheaper than existing food photographer solutions. We currently have two restaurants using our product, and we aim to integrate with delivery platforms to gain access to thousands of partner restaurants. Thanks for watching, if you're a consideration."
DRYVA YC (S22) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08RU-UgCIIE," Hello my name is Tony and I'm the founder CEO of Driver. I'm co-founder of CTO of Driver. Driver is a technology platform that allows companies, whether manufacturers or e-commerce companies, outsource their entire logistics to a single vendor while they focus on their co-business, which is usually manufacturing themselves. What this means is that we provide the transportation services, storage and distribution centres across the country and trust the last mile delivery to their final customer destination. So our good market approach to achieve this was to front load the operations, give it a little risk service level and then use technology to even improve it further. And what did we achieve? 50% on our own time and transaction for customers, trying to be sensitive so they are caused and all the necessary receipts in the business means. Interestingly we've been trapped in this business for over a year. Our turnover in the last one year was about $850,000 and we have a gross margin of 19%. We've also onboarded some of the biggest multinational in Nigeria and Africa including Proxay and Gamble, British American Tobacco and a couple of other companies. So we have the point where we need to scale and we're coming to why seem to get all of that support. Thank you for supporting us."

So say you go into a new product, let's say Kenver and you go there with the intent of just getting an image crop. But you end up learning the whole interface and watching a bunch of videos and reading a lot of documentation, just to get that very simple task done. With Marketrix, we try to solve this problem by first building a special understanding of the product or the website. Once we have that, we use our multi-modal conversational AI to interactively guide the users into the right sections, depending on the type of questions they ask. So users from B2B SaaS, Finance and the legal sector are really love our product and we believe with the intelligent interactions back with digital twins can really boost sales while providing better support as well.

Adlish YC (W2023) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo8pWgWdQ6E," Hi, my name is Iman Chajri and I'm Haseeb Chajri. And we are the co-founders of Adlish. People have had a lot of feelings about ads over the years. We love Super Bowl commercials, but there are also skip buttons on YouTube. Social media, however, has made it possible for creators and talent to promote and sell products in ways that were previously unimaginable. We believe that people are ready to start seeing ads as primary content. Adlish is that dedicated platform that will harness all that creative talent and provide a transparent and personalized ad feed as well as a virtual window shopping experience to the consumer. Our product is ready for launch. We love ads. With its iconic commercial in 1984, Apple revolutionized the personal computing world. Similarly, working closely with Y-cobinator, we hope to launch the next TikTok just for ads. Thank you."

We're currently planning trees to combat climate change and our goal is to have a billion trees planted by the year 2020. We're going to do this by building a fundraising platform so thank Jerty Water but for planning billions of trees. Essentially a user can go to UGeneration.org and they can decide how many trees they want to sponsor and then we'll do the dirty work for them. So we do the research. We figure out which trees go where, when they need to go there, and how to get those trees as quickly as possible. We are also the people that plan the trees. So the person sitting at home doesn't have to go out there by a tree and dig the hole. We won't be planning all the trees ourselves because a billion is a lot. We will be hiring people. We'll hire people. Yeah, and we'll have volunteers. But anyway. I've got many ways to plan that many trees.

Hi, I'm Yapfoy, I'm also a PhD student at Imperial College London and I'm an ex-founder of myself. As budding entrepreneurs we stumbled across this problem where investors and founders find it hard to connect with each other. Especially for a sign founders, find it really hard to reach out to investors given that they do not have it in network already. So to solve this we want to use short form video pitches like the one that you're watching right now to open the floodgates on both sides of the table. We want to bring outlier entrepreneurs in front of the right investors no matter where they come from."

So a big thing with a lot of people who need handyman, they really don't know who to call and we hear about this all the time. I've been a handyman in Chicago for the past few years and I've tested out a few of the competitors apps and I find they just don't provide the value that people are looking for. And for example thumbtack, I signed up with them, you have to put in a credit card as a worker and all that and they charge you per lead and I kept responding to customers and I was getting charged, getting charged and I never got, I never made any money off that app and it's just, that's where we come in and we want to just provide the value that people are looking for and the simplicity then that that's really it, that's where Squirrel comes in and fills the gap.

GuestTo YC Application Video - Winter 2023,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1on2stEXyI," Hi, my name is Jeremy and the co-founder of Guest2. Hi, my name is Sir Gazi and I'm Technical Co-founder of Guest2. A few months ago we decided to find a new and better way to advertise locally, especially due to increasing acquisition costs. After talking to several accommodation hosts, we found out that most of them don't use Skylook software because it requires a lot of metal effort. On the other hand, accommodation guests prefer host recommendation rather than overfollowing information on travel websites. Yeah, so we built Guest2 which basically allows accommodations to recommend relevant local services to their guests with minimal effort and no cost. We began testing with Holy Day in last week and within a week 5% of their guests booked experiences through Guest2. And we think we can do much better than that. We can grow geographically and improve our product and we need you for that. Thank you."

After home will be the platform that brings home buyers, realtors and home inspectors together for collaborative remote live stream inspection and now post COVID world. It's important that we find a more socially distant solution to traditional home inspections. Today, our users no longer have to report to end person home inspections, not only because our loud stream inspections create a more efficient process, but also because it gives you an instant analysis report. On the day of your inspection, you enter a collaborative environment where you and your realtors follow the inspector along the inspection journey as if you were right by his side. You can ask questions and receive instant feedback from your inspection reporting and even get a head start on any necessary repairs. We're building a future where someday you can log into a device and step into the virtual version of your prospective home and every system or component that your eyes land on gives you an analysis report. Wow. Our team as well as Zillow, Angie's Liz, Home Advisor and Thumbtack know that this is the inevitable future. That's why billions of dollars have already been spent to move real estate services online. We'll love for you to partner with us as we build the future of real estate inspections.

Cactus (YC S25) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcyEywNAD4o," Hey everyone, I'm Ali and I'm an engineer at Metta and previously Amazon. Hey everyone, I'm Subi and I'm a product manager at CVS Alphatna. And we are the co-founders of Cactus. Cactus is an AI-powered Icrobroker that helps employers set up health benefits for their employees in minutes and not months. Acro is a sense for individual coverage all three in Brisbane arrangements and it's a relatively new concept in healthcare that replaces group plans. Employers no longer have to be involved in picking and administering health plans. What they do is they set up a budget and employees can use a budget to pick a plan that fits their needs. Icro has grown substantially in the last few years and this year alone is expected to grow by 3.5x. We've talked to customers of existing Icrobrokers and many are still not happy with the manual processes involved in setting up a plan. We aim to use the advancements in AI to simplify this setup by using AI-powered brokers, plan personalization and employee support and reimbursements. And eventually we want to expand this to brokers to automate their client intake. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Hopefully see you in California. Yup."

YC Application Video - Summer 2022,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nVpfX4q1Qw," Hi, I'm Brian Raymond and the founder of Unstructured AI. Unstructured AI will eliminate the pre-processing bottleneck of text, images, and audio data by using a range of machine learning engines. Today, data scientists can access machine learning models in minutes from companies such as Hugging Face, but they can actually use these models until they pre-process their data. But pre-processing unstructured data still requires artisanal one-off solutions for each data science initiative. Providers such as Treff Becta help with this problem for structured data, but there's a gap when it comes to generalized turnkey solutions for unstructured data. Companies licensing algorithms, those providing data annotation services, and internal data science teams will be able to send unstructured AI their data, and will rapidly turn around not only clean data, but also the engines required to clean similar data at scale in their own architectures. Thanks."

Yes, we love our meat, but it is either on a journey or more expensive than it should be, due to multiple million dollars. We launched in January, generating over 250,000 dollars in annual road rage revenue. And we are growing 70% more to government.

I wouldn't trust many people to work on these types of things with me, but these two I have no problem with. It's going fantastically so far. And I met James first a couple of semesters ago in entrepreneurial class, and we worked extremely well together. And ever since had been collaborating and trying to find the idea we want to take to market. And of course, I met John freshman year. We became instant buddies in the programming class.

Teach A Class (YC W2019) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a8HHNbCSaE, Hi my name is Sonia and I'm the founder of Teacher class. A teacher class where building a platform that's engaging in easy to use that helps teachers connect to some of the best solutions out there. That actually matches their needs. Because that's the problem. In India there are plethora of education solutions but none of them actually recognize the role of the teacher. That's why none of these solutions have higher adoption rates. And we want to change that. We want to change that by creating a busy hub where teachers are literally recommending solutions and reviewing products for other teachers. We want it to become a launch pad for some of the best ideas designed by teachers. And currently we're working with about 135 teachers. We're really engaging in supporting them so we learn what works and why. So we can make the best matches possible. I want to scale this to tens and thousands of teachers eventually reaching all 9 million teachers in the country. That's why I'm here.

It is a marketplace designed to bring together trainers who can post fitness content from any location and in any language and trainees. We can access to an international library of exercises and workouts. So how are we different? The majority of fitness subs today are created by the trainer to sell herself and her brand. We do not employ any trainers, but give them the freedom to share content however they like. We're shifting the focus to the trainee who needs variety. There are two of us in the team at the moment. We have a regular reason MVP on iOS and Android. And we're seeing quite positive feedback from our hundreds of early adopters. Our objective at the moment is to achieve a critical mass so we can introduce a monthly subscription. And we'd love an opportunity to learn what I see and bring our idea to every phone. Thank you."

I just graduated from Ustagogywood degree in econ and data science. I lead product marketing and sales at Pony. Hey, I'm John Covr under a holiday working on the technical side. I'm finishing up Ustagogywood now. Awesome. So we're solving for college course registration and basically what happens is classes fill up and students can't add into them. So they end up refreshing a ton or maybe not even getting into the classes that they really need to graduate. We're solving this problem by alerting them when classes open up. We charge them per class. We grew 10% week over week last year and we are getting users to pay twice as much as our nearest competitor course school. Our biggest competitor, Corsical, claims to service 900 plus schools. We talked to users at those schools. We talked to our friends at those schools and we found out that they realistically only service nine schools. This leads us to two radical insights. Students don't trust that course school will send them a text when a spot opens up and they might not even trust that a class will open up. We're going to build that trust really well at UChicago, expand to a few other schools and then we're going to solve this for the world. With your help, see you soon, my see."

Mosy and I have had a very successful business relationship as we had a nonprofit in the past, few small businesses and a really cool startup social network for car enthusiasts. Yeah, and the reason why we're even creating Afterparts right now is because we're both lifelong car enthusiasts, so we know exactly all the pains and all the problems of this niche market, yet how highly lucrative it is, so it's very underserved, and we pivoted it actually from a social network car enthusiast to a payment service because it's such a more valuable solution for our audience. And why we're a great fit for a wide-community in general is because we're both entrepreneurs to our entire lives. We have no college degree, yet we have five working professionals working with us for free, and five amazing advisors who are at top levels helping us out as well to make this vision come true. At the same time, we've been accepting it to a nonprofit incubator called Tech Futures Group, and we're here and we're unusually committed and over one minute. Thank you."
YC Application Video for Nesst.pro - Spring 2025,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA14MoXDxqw," Greetings from Mexico, my name's Lewis. I'm a lifelong entrepreneur. I like to build technology products that solve problems in the world. And right now I see a really big problem in that there's a growing demand for housing and a declining supply of people that can deliver that housing. And there's two key ways to solve the problem. Number one, we need to increase productivity within this workforce. So instead of them outpaying for leads on Yelp or looking around on Facebook groups, we need this two-sided marketplace to match supply with demand a lot better. To understand the nuances of the job like scope creep from either side so that we can avoid disputes through clear communication. And secondly, we need to make it easier and more sexy for the next generation to get their freedom by being a plumber, running their own business without having to learn any software or learn how to run a business. They can just jump on the app, place a bunch of bids and really easily can earn themselves an income while solving this problem for the market. I've had some great success in the past and some terribly painful failures and I would love you guys help. To make sure we get the W this time, make a billion dollar company. Thanks very much."

I lived in 36 countries and I understand how complicated and stressful relocation could be, especially for family guys like Batyr and myself. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of verified information about what steps to take in this new chapter of life. So we interviewed all 100 migrants and it proved our own experience that your location could take up to 4 months of your own life and cost around $3,000 in wasted money. Yes, and our idea is to bridge immigrants who need clear and verified information with experts who already have available knowledge and are willing to share it. And we are using AI to structure this knowledge into concise actionable lists for relocation. Now we're account launching our MVP by demoday, we end to five countries and on board 2000 Bay users.

I'm a vuzanyajemeter. Co-founder of Shungu Technologies. Shungu Technologies, the problem we are trying to solve is the ever-increasing rise of food and transportation costs any time there is an increase in full price. Over the past 10 years, the price of food has increased over 800% in the country and the solution is to introduce electric vehicles into the market. We will be introducing electric motorcycles and electric tricycles, which is one of the major means of transportation in the country. Ibok has always pulled me into his pet project ever since I knew him back in our bachelor's. When we started for our bachelor's in Nigeria, and the most recently, the company involved in two projects during our master's study at Angarozki University, where we designed a mass rover and a CubeSat that didn't launch. This year is the latest brainchild and I personally believe it has the potential to change the world in a big way. Probably the best idea yet. We are hoping for the opportunity to bring this to market and change the world. We are currently at a very early design phase and by the end of December 2020, we should have a fast prototype and running. We are both graduates of the electric engineering and we still have the capability to bring this product to life. Thank you and see you next year."

And also in the past year, we started seeing a lot of policy coming out from government, really controlling how companies are using data, such as with 14.5 and the GDPR in Europe. This is why we came up with SIDER. SIDER is a bank for your data that allows users to control the data while simultaneously allowing organizations access to the data that they need.

We're tackling both the problems of electronic waste, which is the fastest growing waste human in the world, and materials production, which often has a lot of ethical and environmental issues.

We were each other's first college friends at Rice University. We've worked on a lot of projects together, but today we're going to talk about Benchmark. So Benchmark is made up of two primary things. The first is a social network around weightlifting, and the second is a marketplace for workout programs. So Benchmark will allow users to build workout programs, track progress on those workout programs, share workout programs with their friends, and see their friends' workout activity and other content in a feed. We will also allow trainers and influencers to build workout programs and sell them to their large followings on our marketplace. This will replace the existing workflow where influencers build workout programs that excel, PowerPoint, and PDF, and sell them on their personal websites. These are all very inconvenient formats to follow through in the gym. So Jeremy and I are both part of the growing fitness community that wants to connect around weightlifting, but we've also begun to connect with trainers in Equinox gyms in New York City who want to start using Benchmark to distribute workout programs to their clients. So Jeremy flew here to San Diego to film this video, and we're both hoping to fly to San Francisco in January. Bye!"

It's not even like getting a magazine that you'd buy at a new stand for $5 or $6 so that you can read one article.

My background is in building and selling multiple web applications platforms to other companies. Hi, I'm Maxim, I'm a business engineer and I do sales and marketing for Clipido. My background is that I took different management positions at different companies such as being the vice president or IT manager. Maxim and I both met each other when we organized the TEDx event of Belgium where we were both lead organizers. And we started Clipido because we do believe that every company is becoming a media company but the existing software doesn't really support this. So we saw a big gap in the market, solutions were too expensive or too complex and we focus on finding the relevant content and sharing it. So that's why we find it Clipido. Hopefully we see each other at YC. Thanks for considering us, bye!"

Infra School (YC S21) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgGEpLGeIk," Hey, I'm Alex. I'm the founder of Infraschool. Infraschool is building a better on-ramp to recruit in trades. So today, if you wanted a job as an HVAC technician or as an electrician, you would typically go to a one-to-two-year trade school program. It's going to run you about 15 to 30K per year. And when you graduate, you will find yourself making the same amount of money and the same job you could have got had you never gone to trade school. And that's because employers don't value a trade school education. They value on the job experience. So with Infraschool, you participate in a six to eight-week gig program. We teach you the fundamentals. And then we immediately place even to a one-to-two-year apprenticeship program with one of our hiring partners. And when you graduate that program, you're typically making about $45,000 per year. And the best part is that you don't pay anything until you get a job making $45,000 a year. So this is great for students because they're getting on-the-job experience as well as education delivered in a convenient format. And it's great for employers as well because they don't have to spend any money developing or training their own employees. So we're eliminating that cost center for employees. And why is this a big deal right now? Over the next 10 years, there's an expected 3 million jobs to be created in plumbing, HVAC, and electrical alo."

YC application video.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6Qgu2TFN40," Hi, I'm Jackie Power. I have an idea for an app that I believe will change the way people move things or move people. We currently book ahead, we plan, we buy tickets with this app. I would like people to use smartphones to take advantage of current traffic, take advantage of current transportation. People should be able to use their own car as a taxi and rely on good feedback to get business again. Security measures could easily be in place with driving license and various other forms of electronic verification. We should be able to book things spontaneously, whether it's a lift with somebody that's already going in our direction or to documents to be delivered, even plain flights. Flights on aircraft should be made available to us if we want them now and they should go to the high speeder. Thank you."

So CV Nova is a web platform that allows users to upload their CVs so that we can perform content checks and design iterations and send it back to the users.

So we help users correctly and succinctly display information on the CVs, and we automate this process using machine learning algorithms. We've known each other for past six years, we've been together since college, and we've worked closely with many startups, and now we plan to begin our own venture.

Obvious (YC W24) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmCkNdMsCgg," Hi, my name is Dennis. I'm the CEO of Obvious. I'm Martin. I'm the CEO of Obvious. What we're trying to do is make people's implicit preferences obvious. We believe that preference is a visceral thing. It's largely driven on emotion. It cannot be quantified and it cannot be articulated. It's difficult. Our first product, Shop My Style, understands people's preferences, fashion preferences through what they like, save and post on social media. We're taking this information and drastically improving the speed where we get consumers down to the products that they would enjoy. And as a big pitch, we believe that the history of finding products, product discovery, has still been the same since the start of the internet. In the end, we just do move a world where users can carry a digital passport around on the internet and use this passport in any of the vendors they might be shopping on or any marketplace they might encounter. Imagine being able to carry your preferences and unlocking tailored experience along the way. Thank you."
StartUp Ycombinator Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A8FQVp7rbc," Hi, my name is Jason Glancy, co-founder and CEO of Startup. Hi, I'm Rafael Lopez, CTO of Startup. Startup is the first and only incorporation service in the App Store. Our mission is to make starting a company as fast and easy as possible. The problem people face when starting a company is not knowing what to do. Law firms and other online services are too expensive, take too long, and are too confusing for the average individual. We've cut the process in half and allowed people to incorporate in all 50 states in under 10 minutes. To solve this problem, we've partnered with CT. CT is the largest incorporation service company in the world. They own 70% of the market share, are operational in 170 countries, and have over 150,000 law firms in America alone. This is a multi-billion dollar underserved market due to a lack of technological innovation. By partnering with Y-combinator and their mentorship and support, the market dominance of CT and the ingenuity of Startup, we can make the dream of starting a company, a reality for everyone in the world. Thank you."
YoteMeals - YC S20 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDDl7OLR1EY," I was the Zahmet someone who has extra meals and not enough cash. I'm Sebastian, I have enough cash, I don't have meals. So my meals get wasted, his cash gets wasted and we thought it should just be logical that we share our meals but the crime foot provider doesn't do that, doesn't allow that. And when we asked students they were like, yeah, that should be in place but it's not in place. So we were like, let's just do it ourselves if they are not going to do it. So we came up with an idea to create a system that allows individuals to share meals with each other. We call it yolk meals and it's done one of two ways. So basically an individual can sell their meal and someone else can buy it for a reduced price or they can donate it out of their free will. Right? So we basically feel the project has lots of potential not only in this college but around the US but we need YC mentorship and funding to get it to basically kickstart it. And we're thinking about the business that is not centered around profit but around creating actual value and improving the well-being of consumers. Thank you."

Borsa, I'm CEO and co-founder of Kaviat. And Kaviat is here to offer you a first look at your contract so that you can not only better understand what it is you're signing, help mitigate the imbalance of knowledge, but also save you money in the long run with legal fees and also anything else that comes up in the contract that really shouldn't be there. Let's face that contracts are verbose, full of legal jargon, legal ease, unless you have a legal understanding, legal knowledge or access to somebody who does. You don't actually know what's contained within those contracts that you're signing. We want to solve this problem for freelancers at large, but we're focusing on influencers and models to begin with because of domain expertise and we actually have business partners and a wide network active within these industries that we are able to push our product to. And so we actually just started this process. We have a couple of design partners starting just from this week, even like yesterday. So we look forward to expanding that and telling you more about it soon. So thank you so much. Bye."

Previously, I've won the WDC scholarship from Apple multiple times and I was a lead mobile developer at a fast growing VC back company in Berlin. Look, I've bit over 20,000 appointment settings calls in my life and what impacted the most if I convert a lead into a meeting is how fast I can call them up after they submitted a form. The average business needs 42 hours according to Harvard to call up a lead which is way too long. They just have forgotten about you. CETREI calls up leads within 10 seconds and books meeting straight into your calendar. From the very beginning we've been docked feeling with our own tool, booking appointments into our own calendars. Talking to users, the key takeaway was that users don't want to touch any prompt at all. They just want a tool that works out of the box. Thanks for watching."

A tool to help founders manage their equity. I made two-time YC Founders having gone through YC in the summer 2011 and 2013 batches. My first company built a lock screen for Android phones and was acquired by Microsoft. I am building some all because as a repeat founder, I know that managing your cap table is one of the most important tasks it writes. But also one of the things that most founders often don't understand. Founders start a company because there is an idea that they want to realize not to manage a spreadsheet. My goal with Snowball is to make this a lot easier by building a founder-friendly cap table tool. I am a solo founder and have built a phenomenal team of four engineers with folks who have worked at Google and were a former YC alumni. I want to go through YC at third time because our initial customers are startups. Go to market is the first build a self-service tool that manages the cap table for two founders and a garage and then add an additional features so that we can grow as our customers grow. Thanks for taking the time to read our application. I hope to see you guys in January."

PathMe - Application Video YC (Batch S20),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBWoe2cTM3U, Hi my name is Martina and I am Ardín. We are here in San Francisco. We arrived in late December 2007. Yeah and we can say that we spend a lot of time doing networking and sending a recent more than 300 cold emails to investors and venture capital firms and when we start talking with entrepreneurs from here from San Francisco and from our countries Argentina and Europe we realized that they were facing the same problem that sending cold emails with our answers and it was wasted time for them and for us also so we figured out a way to turn the cold emails into warm introductions by giving entrepreneurs the chance to meet and maybe to have a cold or a meeting with investors and venture capital firms. Yes we are going to filter investors and VC firms emails received from those entrepreneurs by using a referral very fine network. So our job will be to provide a qualified entrepreneurs to investors so they know who to meet or have a goal with. So what makes us a subscription service? Entrepreneurs and investors will pay $30 per month and we have now more than what a 200 active users entrepreneurs and also investors and our actual growth rate is 20% month-hour month. Yeah so as we keep scaling to new cities we can reach 300k month-hour month of active customers paying our membership so we could be making around 100 million annual record and revenue. So that's all I see hope to see you thank you bye bye
YC Winter 2020 Video Application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYCdMgBsGsk," Hi, I'm Guillermo, the founder of Multiofeces, which is an online freelance marketplace that connects people who require a technical or manual service for their household with trusted freelancers. So here in Latin America, the cost of manual labor is very affordable, but the problem is the reliability of the service. People oftentimes look into referrals from friends or search in social networks, but this is time consuming and won't provide information that needs further peace of mind. With Multiofeces, we want to improve this experience, make it more simple and more reliable. So from background-chet profiles, estimated budgets, bookings to product quotation, and I will say the main feature is that people will be able to see which of the freelancers are recommended by their friends. So they're already well-experienced, hard-working freelancers that have customers who would definitely recommend them and just a matter of matching these with people's personal networks. That's it, guys. I hope you find it interesting and hope to see you in the interview. Thanks."
YC Application Video 2016,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w59tbi6KWCY," Hi, my name is Deborah Cleaver. I'm the founder of Vogue.org. It is currently March 24th, which means that we are eight months from the presidential election in eight days from the launch of Vogue.org. I really am supposed to talk to you about Vogue.org, but instead I'm going to talk to you about American democracy in general. So as I said, we are eight months from the presidential election, and this is going to go one of two ways this year. Either we're going to continue to tell ourselves and the country, this like really depressing and ridiculous narrative that Americans don't want to vote. And we're going to accept that. And then we're going to sit back as we have another election cycle with depressingly low turnout, which leads to rampant dissatisfaction with government and perpetuates this cycle that we've been in for years now. Or we can throw away that narrative entirely. And we can tell ourselves the truth, which is that Americans absolutely want to vote. And the reason Americans don't vote right now is it's just too hard. Like, we can go on and on about this, but honestly, voting right now is too hard. And we at Vogue.org know in our hearts that Americans want to vote, and they will vote in increasingly higher numbers as we make it easier for people to cast ballots. So that's what we do. We are Vogue.org. We are trusted nonpartisan online hub of all things voting. We provide extremely easy to use tools that simplify these needlessly complicated voting processes from registering to vote to getting your absentee ballot. And then we offer that software to other nonprofits and eventually other candidates who are doing phenomenal voter outreach work. I'm a solo founder, but I am not new to this rodeo at all. This is my fourth presidential cycle. And this is my sixth election cycle. I'm backed by a board that has a collective 50 years of civic engagement experience. I have an advisory board of pretty much every mover and shaker in civic technology. And I just hired my very first engineer. So we've had over 5 million visitors as longdistancevoteur.org. And when we launch as Vogue.org on April 1st, not a joke just the long time, we expect that we will easily have another 5 million visitors by election season. So they're going to visit our site. They're going to use our tools. We're going to follow up with them to make sure that they vote in 2016. And then we're going to turn them out again in 2018. And we're going to keep going until the voter turnout in this country is at an awesomely high number like 85%. So I'm really looking forward to talking to all of you in person. Thanks so much. Bye."

And we are essentially a property platform that connects donors with homeless individuals and families. Now the key is that they must have sustainable income and the only barrier to housing is their deposit cost. That's where we come in. So think of new story charity but ending homelessness in the United States. Up until this point, we've housed 27 different people and 100% of them have been able to stay into homes, along with their being for seven months. So why do we do what we do? Well, when I was a child, I found out my grandfather was homeless and everything said I promised myself that when I was old enough to make a difference, I would. And we're tired of seeing people without a home. We believe that a home is imperative for a stable family life.

I'm 19 years old and I'm a sophomore at USC. I'm studying Business Admin with a minor in entrepreneurship. I founded Leader over a year ago with the mission to effectively level the vertical social media hierarchy and allow anyone the opportunity to gain real exposure, views, influence and cloud just during the things they do every single day. I like to tell people that Leader really picks up where four square of vine and Pokemon Go all left off and what I mean by that is we use a point-based system with automatic location check-in. So everywhere you go all the places you attend the people you meet the fun and exciting experiences you may have all that data is automatically translated into points. A user's daily active point gain plots them on custom geo-target leaderboards in which they compete against their friends and the rest of the community for social influence. More points you gain, the higher if you go, the more times your content is pushed out and viewed by your user base. Also over time these points will be fully renewable for prizes, rewards and experiences pretty much just about anything. We're roughly six to eight weeks out from our launch on iOS and we're very excited at the opportunity to possibly become a wide-computer company. Thank you so much."

So basically our idea consists of an influencer marketplace. We wanted to simplify the way that businesses and influencers connect nowadays. Usually they include it by email and you know, tms, but sometimes I can take over a long time so we're trying to make businesses just do a little promotion. They basically put a little promotion very simple for the businesses. That's our focus. And then influencers go ahead and claim it and they can just go ahead and redeem whatever they would like. We started to work on this project at the beginning of 2021. I used to work with George in another project and I took CSC 50 class with Rose. So I brought the team together to work on this amazing platform. We are finished on MVP in this weekend and ready to test it and next weekend and prepare it to launch. Thanks so much."
Y Combinator Startup Application Video Accepted in 2016 (Indian Founders),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krb96Gaun0o," I'm Rohit. Hi, I'm Priyant. And we are founders of CHILDs. CHILD assesses credit worthiness of international people using their home country's data, social and professional profiles. And we are also trying to provide a P2P lending platform for these people. When both of us moved to US of Wildbag, we didn't have any credit history in US. Because of that, we were not able to get any credit card or we were not able to get loan in US. So when I moved to US of a Wildbag, Rohit came to me with this idea of using data model to assess the credit worthiness of international people. Yeah, and it's not just us, more than 4.5 million people come to US every year on long-term visas and they cannot get access to any of these services because they don't have a credit score. So what we did, we built this data model and we had, using that data model, we had given around 25,000 dollars of a loan on an average interest of 10%. Yeah, and none of those loans are in default and we hope to provide these services to every international person coming to the US and we love your support in that. Thank you."

Homespace is a platform for background checks for casual workers as well as a services market place.

And then I moved to Melbourne in Australia where I started spending three hours a day stuck in traffic just to get to work and come back home. This really annoyed me though because I was spending about a third of my waking hours every day stuck in traffic doing nothing. So I decided to look into it and what I found was amazing. Traffic lights today have no idea about the queue lengths or wait times of vehicles around them. They just know about the first car in every lane by digging a hole on the road and putting a sensor underneath. So I thought why not just build a better sensor that can do all of those things. So that's what we did. We built this sensor and we're selling it to transport departments right now. They're using this to measure how people are using public transport stations and we've done about 50k revenue. And we're really excited about the day where we can put this on top of intersections and control traffic in methods and ways that are much needed for today. Thank you."
Karma Founders Introduction YC Winter 2020 Application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgAaV1IoRLc," Hi, my name is Mink. I'm Jaitanya, I'm Babanjali, and we're the founders of Karma, a mobile app that helps people solve their financial situations by providing them with salary advances, loans and some automated payments as well. All of this we provide to the consumer against zero costs, zero fees, no interest and nothing of that, and we don't even touch a credit score. So what have we achieved in our part of the UKFCS ambush program? We've got an opinion on our ability arbitrage. We have more than 90 high-speed retailers on board and we've taken two employers with more than 100 employees. In total, at the rate of 2019, we received funding to the tune of 500,000 pounds. We have used that funding to create an MVP and we are in the process of building a DLT based transaction system capable of processing more than 100 million transactions in India. That's Karma and Nutshell, which we've achieved so far and we very much look forward to seeing you in California."
advo (YC W21) Video Application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm6XwMPbie0," Hi, I'm Emory. Tomorrow. Stuart. Back. And we founded Advo, the pipeline from donor to changemaker, to empower university advocacy movements. I live with Tamara and live with Stuart for four years. I have known Zach for ten. I live with Tamara's sister. We've worked in and studied diversity, equity, and inclusion for years. Including founding and leading D&I initiatives and organizations. And we're all in to help others do the same. We have friends and colleagues who are professors and advocates in universities, and they all face a problem. They are triply punished. Not only is there a lack of funding for transformative advocacy. Advocates risk falling behind in their academic careers. And they are criticized for complaining and for speaking out against injustice. So we're founding Advo to change this and to change institutions of higher learning. Thank you."
OpenBar (YC S19) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG9DzfYJdE4," Hey, I see I'm Fernando and I'm Obanov and we're students here at Columbia University. We're bartenders too. So let us tell you a little bit about OpenBars. OpenBars is a web-based platform that connects distributors to bars and clubs and other institutions for the purchase and sale of alcohol. So I can speak a little from personal experience here. I hope we're on a bartending school in New York and one of the biggest issues we face on a month-to-month basis is just ordering alcohol. Like you think it'd be easy, right? The problem with direct relationships is that they can be pretty inefficient. Yeah, I mean like you have to like call up a distributor and you have to show you have a proper licensing, ask what product they have in stock and at the end of the day you have to wait for a delivery. So we want to build a platform that addresses all of these issues at once. Yeah. OpenBars connects all of the relevant players, the bars, the clubs and the distributors. The distributors get access to a larger market and the bars and clubs get access to hassle-free ordering and service. Yeah, I mean it makes everyone's jobs easier. So make sure to consider OpenBars."
Rebellious Crops YC Application Video W23,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJnfj40phUE," Hi, I'm Angela. I was the head of sales for Switzerland in Austria at the parent company of Gropa. I also was on the founding team at a consumer package goods lifestyle brand. I'm Kinga. I have a finance degree from NYU. I was a VP at Goldman Sachs and I was born on a farm to a family that's been creating and formulating plant-based products for decades. The two of us met through the YC Founder matching program and we are creating a climate tech ecosystem between farmers and consumers. Yeah, so after working on projects in the agricultural space, we found that farmers really wanted to transition their farmland to organic, gaining a 40% bump in land value and earning higher revenues for organic crops. However, because of generational knowledge in a small subset of crops, as well as limited economics during the three to five-year transition period to USC organic, 94% of farmland is not. This is hitting against growing consumer awareness of climate change and health, which has created and expected 16.5% kegar per year of growth in plant-based milk alone. Ancient grains utilize way less resources such as water and they provide you with a nutty taste and higher nutritional value. They are not free soy free gluten-free, dairy free, low in allergen, and help you with any digestive issues. So our solution is to work with farmers on education and efficiently harvesting ancient greens, giving them the opportunity to transition their farmland and earning come during that time. We will earn revenue by creating tasty and holistic ancient green products for our customers."

Reach Best's Application Video for YC S22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvN3ZS5XROQ," Hi, I'm Rusei Bestayashi. I'm half Mexican half Japanese and I'm a duseburgrically majoring in business and political science. I founded Rusei Best because I saw two problems that international high school students face when choosing and applying universities. When choosing universities many rely on external indicators such as ranking and prestige as opposed to internal motivators such as passion and vision. And when applying to universities many do what is expected rather than what they actually want. And the consequences of that is that many end up going to universities that don't really fit or take appears without a plan and others don't know what to do once they're in university. And also with college consulting services is that mentoring usually over influences students preferences and decisions. And the apps that I got to use were not really helpful to really choose the right universities for you or take action. And so with Rusei Best what I want to do is to give students ownership over their futures. And so far we've had 21st consultations. We worked with 15 paid clients from the US, Mexico and Japan. 82% of those have gone to their top matching university. Actually one just got into UC Davis recently. And I really hope that you believe in us. And thank you so much for listening."

I'm from Rangar, managing the business side. I'm Gita Rvi, the product design. I'm Sonny, the engineer. So we've been friends for some time, but now we're working together at Akra. So now we have a new project called Akra, a multi-purpose messaging app for Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world. Now we're aiming to solve three core problems there. One is information overload, second is a non-contact slow chat, and third is a hassle to move between apps. We start with providing context-low chat room. That's a first-personal group and community chat so people can have more meaningful conversation. On top of that, user can simply connect everyday services from the same app, like ordering food or a school face. We provide chat box with various templates, so partners and brands can use it to connect with their customers. We use machine learning to learn from their interaction and eventually be a bit more predictive and personalized experience for the user within the app. So we use that data to help our clients make more targeted promotion and enhance and also make more contextual engagement with their user. We monetize our chatbot API on an annual subscription basis. So currently we are on a profit top and will be on private beta engine in 2019. Thank you."
Exonode YC S2021 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT-Go7AjvNQ," Hi, my name is Arina. I am CEO of Exynald. We are on a mission to reduce e-commerce returns because like every fourth thing that people buy online is sent back. And the way we want to change that is by offering online choppers who want to return something a special bargain deal and incentive to change their minds. For example, if we offer you an additional 30% discount on those jeans you want to return, would you keep them? Hi, my name is Mark and I develop the algorithm that makes them change their mind. What's great about the algorithm is that it treats customers as individuals. So we look at dozens of different variables like purchase frequency and age and we try to find a return option that works best. So best or more desirable for the customer but also still profitable for the shop. Hi, I'm Arina. As a software engineer, I get asked a lot to join startups. The reason I chose this one is to try to solve a real world problem. The one that affects the environment as well as online businesses. We are developing this product as a software as a service. So it's really simple. Two online shops where just a black box solution they can connect to and use."
YC (W18) Application - SagePath,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOFT9F46_yQ," Hi, my name is Jay-Bong and I'm working on SagePath, a personalized career companion app that helps students build dream careers. So the app kicks off by helping students determine what they want to do by mapping out the entire job market. That in hopes them determine which skills to build as well as how to build those skills via majors, minors and internships. And finally wraps it all up in one nice data-driven profile that reflects not only which skills the users has but as well as how good they are in those skills. So the reason why I started this whole venture is because of my frustrations in the very manual, very inefficient process of going through career guide PDFs, going to career advice all which are very generic. You end up really applying to just a bunch of random jobs and hoping really hoping for a best. And that combined with conditions of hyper competition as well as fast rapid job market change is leading to one eight students to be under employed as well as tens of thousands of dollars per bad hire for employers. And I'm trying to close that gap by better preparing the students for careers they love and making that clear to employers. I'd love to talk more about it in an interview but thank you for your time."

So Alexander and I have been friends for ages since we were six years old in fact. We have complementary backgrounds and skills but most importantly we share similar values which really helps us create a cohesive company culture. So the feedback that we got from our first users really allowed us to come up with an idea that we believe should help us quickly catch up to the competition. In our marketplace we'll have drivers who will be delivering cars to travelers and back to the car owners when the rental is over. That sounds like a great idea to me. Last year we moved to station F in Cuba, here in Paris, not a completely fundraising and launch up product. Now we are looking to join YC in order to find the path to our product market fit."
Y Combinator Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH4VoW4qg_g," Hi, Sam, I'm Jessica, whoever happens to be watching this. I'm Adam and I'm the founder of Collegiate Inside View, and Collegiate Inside View basically provides more comprehensive student reviews of colleges. And the way it does that is basically by asking questions in the reviews that currently aren't being asked. The thesis behind the site basically is that if you ask things directly, they'll get answered, and if you don't ask them directly, they won't get answered. And right now, student reviews ask questions that are way too broad, like, what are the academics like? And I guess that they hope that the reviewer will talk about all of the things that a college applicant would want to know, but this isn't happening. And there's a lot of information that college applicants want to know that isn't being talked about. As for me, I just graduated from Pitt with a neuroscience degree, although I did teach myself coding and all the things that you'd need to start to start up. My motivations, I have a lot of large ambitions, and I'm starting to start up so I can get the money I'll need to pursue these ambitions."

Rivia (YC W23) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkeaRXWn8jk," Hi, YC. We are a review of founders and are applying again after some great progress since our last interview. We now build our SaaS for faster drug development and have launched it to our first biotech customers. So our software has two parts. It has a back end that integrates the data of the biotech and we've already built connection to six different vendors. And the second part is the user interface so that the user can easily oversee the trial as it progresses. And we've built this design on over 60 discovery interviews that we've conducted. As a medical director of several biotechs, the data fragmentation currently makes it very difficult to oversee clinical trials. And I get countless Excel spreadsheets every day. Now with Rivia, I have one platform where all the data is integrated and where it is much easier for me and my clinical teams to oversee all the clinical data. Our team brings together the technical and medical skills and expertise. So we can help the solution that Rivia delivers to make clinical trial conduct faster, more accurate and more relevant. Thanks for continuing us."
YC - Winter 2021 - Application video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPN69yfXJDY," Hi, this is Sai, solar founder of Grassroots from Chennai, India. I have been volunteering with so many NGOs for almost a decade now and what I find is there are so many NGOs having a huge volunteer base who are willing to donate to these NGOs on a regular basis like some small contribution everyone. But because of lack of good systems these NGOs are not actually leveraging this huge donation potential. So what does this we launched our MVP some three months back by June mid and we gave it to some NGOs of which three of them have actively onboarded their donors and still onboarding and so forth. They have onboarded some 40 people and is getting collectively monthly donation of $200 so far. And we need to do some legal stuff to scare before we can scale it up and our system also needs more stability. So once these things are done we will be rolling this out to all the NGOs in our city and the other cities as well. Yep. Thanks. Bye."

On the business side, I started and operated a small but profitable education agency China a few years ago. I also interned at UBC's Conductor Systems tab, work on graph processing systems, and work as an NLP engineer from an early stage of in tech startup based on Toronto. My name is Jack Hong, and my previous role at Phillips Health Tech, I supported the operation of a life critical scalable top system. My name is Felix Foupe, I did an internship at BC Cancer Research Center in Bi informatics, where we utilize the proper list of machine learning model in cancer research. I have experience in robust and reliable ML model design and development. The problems we're trying to solve are once we encounter ourselves on a daily basis as students and teaching assistants. Students have questions when learning and want personalized and readily available help, whereas instructors and teaching assistants are overworked, partly due to asking routine questions, and they're also concerned about student engagement. To solve this, we're building a GPT based virtual teaching assistant. It aims to deliver personalized and engaging learning experiences to online and university courses at scale.

I have 10 years of enterprise sales experience selling machine learning, and I have built bootstrapped and sold an AI company before. Hi, I'm Kevin, co-founder and CTO. I built a recommendation engine in two weeks that beat the YouTube NF Flex teams. Kevin and I go back to last year where we met at H2On worked ever since. So, here is a problem we are trying to solve. Hiring salespeople sucks, everybody knows that. There is a fundamental flaw to having professionally trained sellers sell themselves. It just doesn't make sense. To fix this, we built a platform that can quantify salesperson skills and networks. By featureizing their inboxes across hundreds of metrics, we can predict at which companies they'll be most successful. Our main competition is Brick and Mortar Recruers, that buy large lack data. We started our three weeks ago, built a great team, built a working prototype, and have got a lot of interest from investors without any fundraising efforts. We're going after 400,000 salespeople first, and then our big vision is to turn all of the global hiring into a data driven business. We want to turn an industry upside down, and that's what YC helps companies do best."

Ycombinator Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fiu6w8LFyaI," Good morning. My name is Darren Nitsinsky. I'm the CEO and founder of Wedwood.com. This is going to be a quick team video. Even though the team isn't here, they're going to give you individual videos so they can give it a sense of who we are and why we brought the team together. I've been in the wedding industry since 2001 publishing wedding magazines and this idea for Wedwood came to me one day as I was sitting around and thinking, hey, I got tired of trying to make money off the vendors. It seems like everybody in the industry is designed to make money off of vendors. Well, I wanted to figure out a way to make money off the brides nationally, hence the concept of Wedwood. It's really a name-your-price formula for brides and grooms playing weddings. I spent the last a year and a half making sure that people would actually do what we thought. I won a local challenge here in the Miami-Herald Business Plan Challenge and I was invited to speak. What happened was at that meeting, I met Sean Kerns, who was the CTO and developer of StubHub.com until they got bought by eBay. He loved the concept. It kind of fit with the StubHub model and he thought there was some synergy of buying unbooked time for professionals and then selling it to brides and grooms in the market at a much better price and it seemed to be a similar model. So once Sean Kerns came on board as a part participant and advisor, he then found Steve Perry, who is now our developer for the project in the back end and he's been writing the code since around December with a full robust platform. So it's been a great team. We have good components of each other. I'm the one that drives the marketing. I know the market. I know the industry. So I'm the one that's spearheading the front. Yet Steve, who really knows the back end, he's got a really robust understanding of platform building. And then to get Sean Kerns, who really has proved himself to be a key CTO in the market. So we do think we have a good nucleus of people that can bring together both the vision on the back end and the vision on the front end to the market. Along with the fact that until we actually started building it, we actually proved our market by getting business. So since we start up, I think we've booked over 140 events, generator revenue, and proved that people would actually buy their vendor without meeting them prior to their booking. So I look forward to having you consider us. If we become part of your program, I think we'll be a great addition. And I look forward to any questions or opportunities that we have with you. So thanks very much and hope to see you in a couple of months."

Hello, I see I'm Gata, no pro designer and cajona at Kibio. We're developing QPS and you kind of operate system for private cloud applications. It's basically like Google's Chrome OS with a difference that runs on your own cloud rather than Google's cloud and protects your privacy. So just a go, you face the problem, working on some small project together. We're going to have to save collaborative files storage. Exactly, we couldn't use public cloud storage as like we would drive for a drop box for confidential data and currently available network attached storage devices where simply not sufficiently many aspects. So we started to develop QPS as a universal platform for stable applications that's currently focused on storage systems. We make it accessible to regular Chrome users and small businesses with a well-designed cube. It's basically your own cloud server you can send up in a minute. Many people and companies worldwide need our solution. We believe YC can help us get started even faster and we hope to see you soon in California. Bye, bye."

As you know in Africa, millions of people don't have addresses. So on major e-commerce like Amazon, they don't ship in Africa because we don't have an address.

So, Plan Jobs helps people who are searching for jobs, leverage the network, that is, companies or colleges which they have been a part of in the past for seeking job reference. For anyone wanting to refer, we search all the existing open tech roles in their organization and enable the user to share and manage the referred request sent to him. So, in LinkedIn, we have been observing there is a heavy influx of reference sharing which is going on. But it is mostly an organized and prone to spamming. So, we felt there is a need for a product which gives better and more control to the referral. We have a strong technical background and we are the users of our product ourselves. So, we feel that we are the right team to build the startup. Yeah, and we feel we would be correct, founder, market fit for the problem.

Clearspace (YC W23) Application Video (Accepted),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkOpG3kqmy4," It's up, YC. I'm Oliver. I'm Rice. And we are building ClearSpace. ClearSpace helps eliminate compulsive phone usage. Most people we know hate their relationship with technology right now, and they hate their relationship with their phones the most. In Oliver and I are no different. As software engineers in the middle of pandemic working remotely, we both independently hack together attention protection stacks to keep us from doom scrolling instead of doing the things that mattered most to us during our day. People are wasting more and more of their lives on things that they don't care about. And ClearSpace is the only thing we've tried that actually solves this problem. ClearSpace came out of some of those early hacking sessions and has already saved over 500,000 wasted scrolling sessions for users. That's that is the thing that gets us out of bed every morning and it's what we want to spend the next decade of our lives working on. We would love YC's help building and scaling that vision. Thanks. Thanks."
Clique (YC W2017) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU6vQdpVf6o," Hey, I see my name is Hoy. I'm one of the co-founders of CLIC. I do apologize and my partner Brandon is unavailable to make this video with me by the deadline so this should just stuck with me. CLIC is a social media business promotion platform that is actively pursuing to help small and middle-class businesses advertise and to promote themselves and to truly reach their entire market. I myself come from a family of small business owners and Brandon has been working at an advertising agency and we notice that there is this unbelievable margin between small and middle-class businesses in comparison to large businesses and the way they get to promote themselves. An example is I ran across a restaurant the other day and I got to speak with their owner and they had this grand opening sign on their front door and he was complaining that they've been open for two years but this is the way that they can bring people into their restaurant and with where technology is today they shouldn't have to resort to that. A good way to pick what we're trying to do for you guys is the new Pokemon Go app in the way that the Poke stops would be like the businesses themselves and they would be able to customize the rewards at the stops and the advertisements and the promotions and users would be able to go there and you're given radius and see this and this would in terms of localized advertising and really help businesses and so that sums up click and I hope you guys like the idea. Thank you for the time and we hope to hear from you soon. Bye."

My name is Manin, I am the founder of Musk and we want to build a carbon pricing software for companies to track their carbon footprint and do projects to mitigate that and move money around internally to make the world more sustainable. My background is in electrical engineering and when I was working I saw a lot of clients wanted to do the right thing with buying renewable energy but the prices were just not comparable. And being an immigrant and somebody who lost his dad at a very young age, I understand the meaning of risk management.

And we tried to contact her and her neighbours and unsuccessful, which was lying on the floor perhaps a day before she was found. We're building a really normal technos technology that costs a fraction of existing solutions in the market. And that product will allow you to keep track or monitor an elderly person from anywhere in the world and most important things they don't have to interact at all with technology. We have hardware already in the production. We're working on the software for a type right now. We have a letter of intent from hospital and sent here, here in Hong Kong and in New York already. We've got over 20 years experience in healthcare and technology. And we're going to come to the US because it's the world biggest market. It's spent over $800 billion last year on dementia alone.

We have redesigned the way of doing marketing with Smuggling, allowing advertisers to measure and optimize their impact of their marketing spending. Well this in itself is not really something new.

All this in order to penetrate a very attractive mid-market segment, which traditionally has not been able to afford this kind of solutions in the past, but is already spending more than $24 billion in marketing analytics. So far in 2017, we have signed contracts for $400,000 in several countries, if Latin America.

MetaDoin (YC S22) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZuoMwSo5C4," What's up, YC? My name is Samir and I'm the founder of MetaDuin. A bit about me I graduated from SJSU five days ago and have work slash interned at Web3VC funds. MetaDuin is the first social talent platform utilizing the blockchain to create verifiable marketplace for Web3 freelancers. Every time a freelancer completes a job, they add it to their blockchain resume and on the social side there has never been a social platform where freelancers can create content and connect with other freelancers. Similar to how LinkedIn does for traditional jobs. Current status is my team is building out the MVP and we were just a winner in the Silicon Valley business plan competition. MetaDuin will become the world's greatest platform for freelancers and YC can be the launchpad that gets us there. Furthermore it would be an honor to be YC's first Avgant founder. I'm located in Dublin, California and the YC offices are just a short drive away. Thank you."

Sumer Application Video for YC W22 (Selected for YC Interview!),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of1NyuLWiBI," Hi, I'm Mohamed and I'm Frank and we're actually fourth year University of Toronto students. We met in second year though and we've been best friends ever since and we're about to graduate this December. Yeah, so we met at our internships and since both of us were in the same department so we happen to you know have a lot of conversations together we talk about relationships, work, startup ideas. And since both of us were living in residence back then and had a hard time finding groceries. So we created a company that delivered groceries to resident students. And we actually started with that idea and we applied to YC with that idea last year but our revenue started to fall. And so we did customer interviews and we found that they wanted a cheaper and faster grocery delivery company. So we started, we launched as the first and only 15 minute grocery delivery service in Canada and we charged a $199 delivery fee. And we saw a lot of changes. Yeah, so since then our revenue has gone up pretty quickly. Specifically in the last month our revenue almost tripled. So we want to do more customer interviews and what the customer is telling us is that you know they really enjoy the grocery delivery experience. They never try something so fast and so cheap before and I think we're onto something big. So YC, see you soon."
Tumalow YC Summer 2019 Application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMkzNKpFrTc," All right, so we're Tumolo and this is our Y Combinator team video.

Packs (YC W2022) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwyd5jrm66E," Hey there, this is Steven Luquia's a badass self-top programmer who's been the lead on countless projects over the last 20 years. And this is Joanna Weeb, she built copy hackers which brings in 3 million a year. We met Adam to it and now we're building packs together. Which started as a simple way to save all your links and files on a top. I mean, we first built it because I just wanted to save a link in a client's Google Drive and I couldn't. It turns out drives are really precious about their platform and basically hate all other final types. So we built packs as a place to put any file type and add context to it. We wanted to organize the chaos of online work. Right. Which alone is pretty cool, I think. There are a lot of unorganized assets out there with more than 600 million people using online drives. So that's a lot. And packs can organize all of it like a breeze. And packs can do even more than that. A pack is like a webpage but better. It's an online drive with a style UI. So we're taking our websites too. Which is a big frightening idea and we love it. The whole world can one day save all their stuff on a pack. So please let us interview for Y Combinator Winter. Thanks."

Perch YC application - W24,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpNrqJQoO-8," What's up, YC? I'm Dustin, computer science graduate from the University of Florida. I do all the tech and design for Perch. And I'm JJ. I'm a current student at UF, a former college athlete, and I handle all of the operations, marketing and customer support. So every football season hundreds of thousands of fans struggle to find parking in Canesville, ultimately having to settle for overpriced spots that put them miles away from the stadium. Meanwhile, local property owners stand outside holding up cardboard signs and after manually funnel cars into their lot. Perch bridges this gap, property owners can list their spots in advance for fans to pre reserve completely streamlining the process on both sides. Last year we did about $3,000 in reservations just due to a single Facebook post and some fake parking tickets that we use as flyers. This year we're four games into the 2023 football season. We've done over 800 reservations for $50,000 in gross merchandise value and fans rave every single day about how much we improve their game day experience. But for us, college football parking is just the beginning. We want to take this solution and scale it across the globe to other locations and venues and we would love YC's help in getting there. Nice guys."

Cyder YC S2022 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mYNcpiRsSo," Hey, my name is Sikmin Delae, CEO and co-founder of SIDER. My name is Lucas Delae, CEO and co-founder of SIDER. Over the last few years, we've worked as data consultants to realize that organizations are addicted to collecting user data, but users are becoming more conscious of their privacy and want to receive value for their data. This is why we came up with SIDER. SIDER is the world's first decentralized data trust that allows users to protect the privacy, control their data, and earn royalties. The way that it works is that developers build applications that connect to our decentralized and protected data trust that gets monetized through smart contracts. Throughout this entire process, users have control of their data and receive tokens for the data that they share, and those tokens get shared with the developers inside or as well. And in the last month alone, we launched our data, which is awesome. We onboarded over 100 people to use our product. We're able to block over 200,000 invasive cookies and trackers, pay our users out 20,000 different tokens, and the best part was we were actually able to pay them out in actual monetary value as well. So with that, we're hoping to join YC, get it scaled, and get this thing off the ground."
AmeliorMate YC Summer 2019 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yBBkBr71xA," I see this is Katie Ivanko Douglas, Founder and CEO of EmilearMate. We connect tech companies and government agencies to help solve problems in hybrid warfare, online radicalization and the violence that it leads to. It's not the start-up I ever imagined I would start, but I feel it is my moral imperative because I don't see anybody else with a higher chance of success. I think I have a chance of success because of my interdisciplinary background studying international relations, which is a lot of studying warfare. My professional background is in sociological research. Our MVP is a book that's giving people a common base of knowledge for these problems. My background is in research, but you won't see me on a lot of academic papers because I do a lot of professional papers that are confidential and are worth thousands of dollars in solve specific problems. So it's that background that I'm bringing to our MVP and watching this company."

We are just at the beginning of the project but we are convinced about its extraordinary potential. So we hope to meet you soon guys. Have a wonderful day. Bye-bye."

Affordable Equity YC W18 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqNH9N_dpXU," I'm Steve Taylor, founder of Affordable Equity. Affordable Equity is a social enterprise for affordable housing that scales to meet the scope of the problem that we have. There are three things that are really important for you to know about affordable equity. The first is that we invest in a portfolio of properties about half market rate and half affordable. This allows us to offer a competitive rate of return while still preserving a significant portion of housing for affordable housing. The second thing is we reserve 2% of the equity in the fund for residents of the affordable housing units to earn through on-time rent payment, through participation in the community, and through maintaining their property. So they get to build wealth while renting, and we get to decrease our property management costs. The third thing, we're designing everything from the outset to be replicable so that we can build a community of social entrepreneurs to replicate this in cities all across America and really impact the housing crisis that we have. Thank you very much."

So what we are is last year we met into an entrepreneur class and they gave us 10 minutes to go meet each other for unfamiliar faces and exchange contact information to be able to collaborate over the course of the term. After that 10 minutes was done, I had this guy's name save with no phone number. This guy's number with no name. I still can find him on Facebook because he spelled his last name differently than he did in real life. We discovered there has to be a better solution for this. We experienced a real pain point. So we went ahead and built a mobile application that's out on Android and iPhone. And with the tap of one button, you'll follow each other on all mutually shared networks. So that's Instagram, SoundCloud, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. And that's just for now. We're going to add a lot more. So please invite us down so we can be warm again.

Hillside Hydro (YC S2017) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d78scvcYOq0," My name's Hunter Hartzorn, and I'm Jasper White. We're the co-founders of Hillside Hydro, where we've developed a portable hydroelectric generator for backpacking and camping. As avid backpackers and hikers, we found that it's very difficult to keep our electronics charged while on the trail. Backpackers currently only have two valid solutions to charge electronics in the wilderness, micro solar and external batteries. After speaking with hundreds of customers, we found that these methods were inadequate and that they needed a better way to charge on the trail. Our solution utilizes the power of small bodies and moving water to charge your electronics in the wilderness. Conveniently, most campsites are located near moving water. Simply place our generator in the small stream next to your campsite or pull behind your kayak and you'll have power to charge your electronics for the rest of the day. We've been working intently on this product for the last ten months. We've developed several working prototypes and acquired thousands of interested customers. We even had a video of our product receive over three and a half million views on social media. We think through the Y Combinator, we can really take our business to the next level. Hope to see you in California. Come April."
Off The Record (YC W17) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDKUT7BfgxQ," Hi, I'm Alex. I'm Chris and I'm Mark. You might recognize us since you've turned us down twice now but every time you emailed us to let us know that we were in the top 10% You know what? That's not going to cut it. We decided that if you turn us down again next year we'll apply with those triptees. Been warm. All kidding aside, we've just turned one year old and we've made great progress the last few months. When we applied last summer we were working with less than 10 attorneys. We had a presence in two states and sales of $7,500 a month. Today we work with over 50 attorneys. We have a presence in 18 states and sales of over $50,000 a month. Off the record is a service that takes the guesswork at a hiring and attorney. Say you get pulled over. You have no idea which attorney stands the best chance to get your ticket dismissed. We do. And we started with traffic tickets because it's the most common legal issue affecting over 40 million Americans every year but we plan on applying the same business model to a slew of other legal services. Right. Our vision is to make legal services easily accessible to all. 60% of Americans don't have access to an attorney when they need one the most and that's just not right. We need you as a partner to help us level the playing field a lot faster. Thank you guys."

What are you the co-founder of? Cater. I'm the co-founder of Cater, and I'm the CTO. I'm a UC-like graduate and a former Microsoft engineer. We are building the AI data analyst.

Additionally, we're currently iterating on our product with a feedback of over 50 potential early adopters. And we've got some great results. Yeah.

Mach Capital YC Application Video S19,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbIEHg7mscE," Hi, I grew up in Palo Alto and I've always had an admiration for Silicon Valley technology and innovation, but now I feel really disappointed. I started a company that made the strongest materials in existence, sort of a really basic thing that humans do, starting with stone tools and looking at how we can iteratively make technology better. So the fact that people wouldn't understand strongest materials in existence, no one even asked what that even me known has ever questioned me on that statement. It's just really disappointing. I think why see at the time when we applied before with Mantis, that was too early, but now it's clearly a mistake in the industry and because of that I've resigned from Mantis composites and I'm starting Mount Capital, a firm that is going to dress this weakness in the industry, both addressing aerospace and really hard fundamental technologies. A lot of businesses today, they just focus on taking things that people will know work and doing a new business play. But now, because of the technological environment, it truly is possible to have small startups making huge technological leaps and advances and especially with existence of Mantis and companies that will use that technology, we're going to see a lot of leaps in these systems that are part of network systems within aerospace, for instance, with satellites as they get smaller, with aviation as UAVs get smaller, you get both the military effects and the urban mobility. So all those areas are going to combine and there's a lot of subsystems that will sell into those and I'm the best person to be funding them."

Rivia YC (S23) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XdQV0mhksg," IYC, third time the charm. Our SaaS is a data analytics platform so that biotechs can measure the performance of their clinical trials. Since our interview, we have built, sold, and observed the benefits from our biotech customers. In fact, since last month, we are generating 40,000 in annual recurring revenue. So Hank, what's the problem we're solving? As a medical director or various biotechs, I have really struggled with the data fragmentation around my clinical trials, making it impossible to get a good overview of what is happening to my patients. And this is why I then ask Tergo, how we can solve this. Right. So Rivia is a centralized platform for the biotechs to access to all its clinical data from multiple sources in real time. So our data engine collects data from any source and we can build those connections in weeks, not months. So that's a game changer. And the web interface for current customers allows them to answer clinical questions very quickly. In fact, on Monday, we just did the handover of the tool to our first US customer. So I'm quite looking forward to their feedback. So what are the benefits that Rivia will provide to you? Well, you save time. And secondly, you reduce the data handling errors. And thirdly, you get your frequent insights into this unfolding real time trial performance. And this independently from you vendors and all the people involved, meaning that as a biotech, you answer your questions and bring your drug to market faster. Perfect. Thank you. That's good. Woo."

And I'm a Tias, I had a competitive program for a lot for years and I've handled all about algorithms and back in development. And we built syntax and ultra-personalized AI tutor for Latin Americans that can help us learn a new language in other six months. We emulates realistic conversations and improve speaking by holding virtual meetings with an AI tutor. At the beginning, as developers, we used tools like Doolingga and Cake to improve our English. But these tools did not prioritize speaking skills which hurt our developer friends and ourselves when working abroad. After a 100 interviews, we found that Latin American developers have pressure to learn how to speak English fluently. But it's so hard to find a practice partner. The language learning in Latin America is so expensive. Time consuming and offers no more intents to learn the language. On very will launch a web app with 20 users to access the idea through interviews and also to understand how to make a better AI. Now we have our three more developers to work with. And launch with an MVP with 20 users paying $6 a month. For this year's second quarter, we expect to reach a false end yourself from Mexico Peron."
Sapien YC W20 application video - Update: we were invited to interview!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iegcA3JdOqY," Hi, I'm Akash, hey, I'm Anon, and we're the co-founders of SAPIEN. I'm really excited to announce that we just graduated from startup school. So what is SAPIEN? SAPIEN is a SaaS platform for career fairs that better enables recruiters to connect with, track, and higher candidates. We think the problem is that career fairs are broken. Companies invest a lot of time and money scanning through resumes, filtering out information, and they find it difficult to get life candidates into their applicant tracking systems. So how do we solve this problem? SAPIEN streamlines this process with an iPad platform for recruiters, as well as a mobile platform for candidates. On the recruiters side, recruiters can view candidates' information ahead of time and short list candidates that they're interested in. On the candidate side, candidates can import their backgrounds, sign them to meet companies at career fairs, and even communicate directly with recruiters. So we've already developed a prototype of the recruiter platform, and we've been working pretty closely with recruiters to best understand and serve their needs.

YC S15 Video Application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CciBjoTaZIc," Hello, why are you combinator? My name is Phu. My name is Phu and we are the founders of AMIA. So basically, AMIA is a mobile app that let you share with your friends what you want to do today. And AMIA is the solution we come up with for the problems we're facing. The problem is when I try to ask my friend out, so we try to ask his friend out. Often times we get rejected because the schedule then moved and then we'll hang out with that time. And with AMIA, you can ask your friends out without the fear of rejection because we try to eliminate those friction in hanging out together. So for example, if you just found a new restaurant, an interesting one, you can just share that on AMIA so that your friends can look at them and say, oh, this sounds like a good idea. They may share. You don't have to invite all of your friends again and again again. Yeah, and also like when you share it up right and you look at the friendless, you know which of your friends also want to go to a restaurant tonight. And you can contact those people and you know for sure they're in the mood and they're afraid to do that. Thank you."

In the UK alone it's set to go 25% by 2023 to 2.1 billion pounds. Online booking platforms are huge, think Airbnb, think tree well. Customers are demanding a more efficient way to book services 24-7. So what are we? We're exactly that. Splute is an online booking platform that allows dog owners like Brendan and I to go on and search for book and pay for dog wellness services in our local area. Think grooming, training, dog therapy and for those service providers it gives them access to a huge pool of customers that they can have been able to get in front of before. Our MVP is around eight weeks away where we'll be looking to test with businesses and customers. That's why we want to come to IC. We want to grow our business and we want to be first to market. We hope that we can all come and see you guys soon."
My Y Combinator Application Video that Got Us an Interview (in 2015),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuLys6Wjp5U," Hi there, my name is Ed Can co-founder. Hi, Nikolay Todorov co-founder. So MD&A Cloud is an analytics and engagement platform that assesses employees in tracing motivation and then visualizes it all onto a social graph showing team relationships and culture fit. I created it because I was experiencing problems as a manager where I worked. I had the same problem in my team and the issues had to do with lack of engagement and a multi-generational workforce. So we created the first assessment then turned into a software with feedback and that grew the company from $2.1 million to $10.36 million a year. Other companies started seeing it. They said, hey, can we buy it? Can we try it? We said, okay, it made $73,000 on its own which went back into development. So I decided in December to quit my job, go in the startup full time and since then it's been growing an average of 23% revenue every week. I love working on the software side of the project. So see you in California."

Cleley was born during YC Star Ups Cool 2022. And it's an app we wish already had existed. Yeah, we're so used to the convenience of getting everything pretty much delivered to our door steps.

So we helped them by building their business blog so fast. And we also gave three more key features that helps their business. First one is a CTA button so that our users can convert their readers into their customers. And second, we don't have our own editor, but instead we gave a notion link copy and paste option because most of our users that we interviewed, they're writing their first draft in notion. And third, we helped them sign sub directory or sub domain easily so that they can increase their SEO score by using our product. So it took around three weeks building our product until now. And we have just launched today. So I hope to see you soon again and talk about this a lot. Thank you for listening and I hope to see you again in California."

Mys Tyler - Application to Y Combinator Winter 2021,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsjDvX5dpus," Hi, I'm Sarah from Miss Tyler, an app making it easy to find and buy clothes that will look good on you and that don't need to be returned. The way we're doing this is with a matching algorithm where we can identify people or contributors who look similar to you in terms of height, size, shape and coloring. So that what looks good on them will look good on you. These people go out there, do the hard work of finding clothes, trying them on and identifying what looks good and showing you how to wear it and where to buy it. In return for people clicking on links and buying directly from brands, we receive a affiliate commission that we share back with the contributor. We're mining the long tail of influences. There's 30 million influences out there who represent the population. And this means that no matter what you look like, you're finding people who look similar, who are body confident and know how to fly to their shape. So it's truly accessible inspiration. We've had quite a lot of traction so far. We've had 40,000 people do our fit algorithm. We've had 14,000 downloads. We have unborted 55 contributors and 120 brands. And we would love to be part of YC to take us even further. Thank you."

Limpid is a dashboard that helps SMBs to better manage their SaaS vendors. So nowadays, the average company uses 130 different SaaS applications across all team members. Most of them are known for management and so this creates a huge amount of spending, operational and compliance issues.

And that's where our company comes in. Currently, we're currently with over 1200 service companies in Atlanta and we're hoping to expand into more categories in cities. So with your help, we look to further bridge the gap between people and services. So we'll see you this summer. See you in California!"

We're looking at basically banks enforcing or instructing companies to follow their censorship rules and basically Centralization as a whole is just bad for companies for freedom of movement and being able to choose who they want to work with.

And I used to work at Salesforce as a senior software engineer. A few years ago, Riden and I decided that we wanted to build something for one of the most important parts of our community. Barbershops and salons. We went out and spoke with over 200 beauty professionals. And we realized that they are missing a lot of opportunities by relying on multiple systems to operate their business. They're using social media to market their skills and services and to engage with their customers. But there's no easy way for them to manage appointments and process payments on those platforms. So they're using book intervals to schedule appointments and process payments, but they can't engage with their customers like they can on social media. And that's when we realized that combining community and a booking platform together can help them drive more bookings. We launched this to be just a few days ago. And we already have 500 users over 100 appointments and 47 beauty professionals on the platform. So come and talk to us to find out why we're a great fit for the winter 2024 batch. Thank you."

Prior to founding Mulberry Street, I was the sole founder for a jewelry company called Ava Jory that I built from ground up and now it's selling at Neem Market Stories in the online stores as well. And I'm Nikki, another co-founder of the Mulberry Street. I have a background in marketing and I'm worked with several Fortune 500 companies. I most recently led an accelerator division comprised of marketing strategists and we helped start up companies with their acquisition and retention plans. So the Mulberry Street is an online marketplace for buying and selling used kids items. You can actually think of it as posh mark for kids. Nikki and I are both moms and we know this struggle is real where we not only need a lot of things for kids but we also end up accumulating a lot. So we wanted to find and make a consolidated place for buying and selling used kids items but also creating a community of supportive parents locally. And we think this idea could work because the retail market is a multi-billion dollar industry. It's expected to rise from 26 billion currently to 64 billion by the end of this decade. So where are we at? We have a website that's in beta testing. We've run product trials with 50 women. We've gathered feedback from them and are incorporating that into the website. We have a hundred, acquired a hundred signups and our list is growing on a weekly basis. And we hope to see you soon and thank you for taking the time and we look forward to hearing from you all.

Dedsimple - YC Winter 2018 Application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PNC1jH78p0," My name is Dio. I'm Jay. We're two of three co-founders creating a machine-learned framework for visual recognition. We want to abstract or reduce the complexities surrounding camera-based artificial intelligence so that third-party developers and small-time-medium-sized businesses can build upon our framework. Jay, can you give an example of how third parties could use our framework? Yeah, we recently released Puppiei, which is an iOS app that allows a user to simply point their phone at a dog and the app will determine the breed of the dog in real time using the local processing power of the phone. And so third parties that write on-so-out framework can be certain to receive edge computing quality service because we do everything locally in the client while trained in the cloud. And we're going to provide APIs that allow gathering data sets, efficient cleaning of data sets, and optimizing models for specific camera-based problems. Thank you."
YC Application Summer 2019,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J46dOd3O-9M," Hi, my name is Shubb. And I'm John. And we're the founders of Stute. Oftentimes, at these highly competitive academic universities, their students extremely involved, but also academically concerned. These highly involved students struggle to find time during the week to study for exams and prepare for projects. This leaves them a mountain of academic responsibilities, and they fill the gap by googling, brute force learning, and pulling all nighters. Even if these methods do suffice, they leave behind a lot of stress and academic anxiety. And the Stute team knows this just like anybody else. And that's exactly why we're in the business of eliminating college anxiety. And we're doing this in two ways on our mobile app. The first is that we're matching up students who have already taken the class and passed it well. They are a resource to these new students, and they can tell them how to study for that final as an example. And the second way is we're matching up peers who are currently in the same classes. By providing access to these two different avenues for students, we're seeing growth. However, we want to grow at that YC speed, and we would love to, we would love your help. Thank you."
id. (YC S2016) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNIV_4GOnY," Hi, my name is Paul and on behalf of my teammates Matt, Curl and Sam, we are Id. And Id is a legal research tool that helps attorneys more accurately evaluate legal risks and rewards by predicting litigation outcomes. Essentially what we're doing is that we're predicting and identifying optimal scenarios and conditions in which they can win a lawsuit. And we first came upon this idea simply from personal experience. Myself and Matt were both law students and we're both pretty familiar with the short coming so the current tools that are out there. And at first we set out just to inject some efficiency into the process but we realized that in doing so that we could also provide a tremendous upside to the user. So we're not only decreasing the cost associated with legal research but we're also providing a tremendous opportunity to convert what was formerly a cost center into a profit generator by maximizing your earnings from winning cases and minimizing the damages from losing ones. And right now we're past the mock-up phase. We're working on our prototype and we hope to see you guys in California in the summer. Thanks."

We are building a fully immersive comic creating and publishing platform with consistent characters and audio facts. Well, I've been in this space for over a year now since the beginning of the journey of AI Wave. And the biggest barrier that I noticed of the image-based media is character consistency. That's like the largest bottleneing right there. Creators can use our A-models to generate characters and their voices, backdrops, and compelling audio as well, speeches for each speech bubble with, you know, soundtracks. Building so far, this need arsonars to draw a web tune on a complex Adobe Illustrator like UI. And it requires extensive technical knowledge, expensive tools, and countless hours. To solve this issue, we have raised 50k from my ex colleague at Air Chat, Cigil-1, and Redvice Founders, Daniel Dillon, and Tristan Homsi. Well, we are hungry down right now, building and shipping from San Francisco. Yeah, it's our scope. We love the energy here. We love the city. Cafe to see you all at YC. Thank you. Thank you."

I'm a 26-year-old engineer from New Market, Ontario, Canada, and it's my life stream to start a company that makes a really big positive impact on the world. About seven years ago I started teaching myself full-stack web and app development and since then I've created dozens of partial MVP's. I've had hundreds of started ideas and I've worked as a consultant and contract developer for various different startups. Over the past four years more specifically I've been working the Web3 gaming space, building tools and dApps for different gamers and indie game developers. I'm really excited about the Web3 gaming space because I love the opportunities provides both gamers in terms of partial ownership in the games they play as well as indie game developers in terms of decentralized crowdfunding. About two years ago I read a web for theoretical network design, our network paper, like what a Web4 network would be like and since then I've been working on designing the first Web4 network. I think I have to complete my design now. I'm just working on getting the research paper peer reviewed and edited and then I helped to publish it and yeah it would be really cool to be accepted to YC but watching a ton of the startup school videos recently and they have been extremely helpful to me as someone who doesn't really have any kind of like founder support network around me. I don't really know a lot of founders or people who have started successful companies so I really appreciate that free content. I don't want to go too much too much longer than I need to so I just say thank you very much for your time and yeah I hope to hear back fairly soon. If I don't get accepted this year I'll be applying again and again or hopefully finding product market fit on one of my MPs eventually. Thank you take care."
AutoMEP (for YC Winter 2020) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdBDyhNrbX8," And Naman Kassli, and my school friend Ruchin Mahadev, were the founders of Auto-AAP. We at Auto-AAP are trying to automate the design, dropping a lot of manual calculations that were in construction engineering. When a house is in the building, an architect prepares a floor plan. On top of that, an NEP consultant designs the mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems. These systems are the nerves of the building, and you need them for proper functioning of the house. But boy, engineering these drawings is a tough and an error-prone task which only experts can do. We are working with a firm called Shrejhtha. And Ruchin can just show us around the consultants there. These consultants can now focus on site work rather than sitting in front of test stops. We are targeting a global billion dollar market here. And getting into YC would help us grow faster. Thank you."
Application to YC summer 2020,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvl50kNKgSo," Hello again, my name is Dennis. My name is Olya. I'm Nick. This is our second attempt to apply to a YCVS backup bot. Our feedback service from restaurant owners. That's what we have achieved since our last application. We almost double user base, double customers on paid subscription, got more than 1,000 reviews from restaurant visitors. We found that in addition to a feedback service, restaurant needs instruments to retain regular customers and attract new ones. And all this should be in one simple and convenient solution. We believe that such solution could be a backup bot. Because today restaurant owners struggle to use separate services and social media to meet the needs. So we invited two new members to help us to build that product. One of them is Olya. I have experienced working as a news writer and I know how to help restaurant owners to communicate with customers better. Another member of Olya is currently in Germany. And he was able to offer our service to several restaurant owners in Dortmund and convinced that they were facing the same problems. Hello guys. Unfortunately, my offer was declined. Due to lack of legal integer registered in the European Union and GDP restriction. But as far as we know, legal support and incorporation are why it could be entered superpowers. So we look forward for cooperation. So, help us to book a bot to the next level. We hope to see you soon. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, stay healthy and goodbye. Bye."

Dream Chaser Program (YC S21) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lLar-9m_4s," Hi, my name is Naila and I am the founder of the Dream Chaser program. The Dream Chaser program is a program that I created to ensure that underprivileged dancers are able to have an equal chance at succeeding in the dance world by providing them with monthly dance care packages and enrolling them in our mentorship program. All free of charge. So the reason why I did this is because there's a huge... Many dancers don't get the same equal opportunities as the other dancers in our dance world. And it's a huge problem because it lowers our chance of representation in the black community of having black ballerinas. Which is why most times whenever you think of a black ballerina you can only think of more, which is probably as decode one. And I want to help to bring more dancers to the light so that it's not any more rare occurrence to see a black professional dancer. Thank you."

Svingo is a person-to-person international cargo delivery platform that we are working on since July 2018. We have two software developers and one community manager right now and we are on the MVP phase. And why are we doing this? Because we experienced the worst of it, first experienced money and the broketic phase and I experienced the bureaucracy and the time phase of it. When my package arrived, the winter was already done and I didn't need a pair of boots anymore. So we said, okay, there has to be another way. And we made some experiments from couch surfing and other platforms and we saw that people can bring each other any items they can want except for the illegal items. So we said, okay, we can put this in a platform and make everyone benefit from it because life is better when it's easy. Thank you for listening us."
Remembrall YC Application (W24) - Accepted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGXkghBFtL0," Hey, I'm Ronik and I'm Adi. We met four years ago studying computer science at MIT, and we're both second time founders. Now, Ronik and I are building Remembral, a developer tool that gives large language models access to longer-term memory. We built Remembral about three weeks ago, after I was struggling with a couple of different LMB side projects I was working on. It was really just for personal use, but I decided on a whim to tweet about it, and it got an insane response with hundreds of thousands of views. I realized I was on something with memory management, and other people probably had this problem too. That one tweet led to nearly 300 people reaching out, and asking to use Remembral for a really wide variety of use cases. We've realized that remembering details about the user fundamentally changes the user experience for these AI products. It allows you to turn the unstructured user data into actionable user profiles. And this means more personal conversations with chatbots. It means co-pilots that are better equipped to serve your needs and a lot more. We found that already 88% of AI founders are using retrieval as part of their LM stack, and they say it will continue to be a really important piece of the puzzle. Remembral can help empower builders to go even further with memory, and we'd really love to join this upcoming YC batch as we build that feature."
Airborne's Application Video for YC W22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6mKXaA0qrY," Hey I am Sakeeth from Airborne and I would like to start with a question. Why food delivery companies take so long to generate profits and what is the main reason being it? Guess what? Not because of the cost related to customer acquisition which is majorly talked about but because they have to pay a huge amount of money to their delivery partners which is 665% and lots of 6 being one of the major wing of their business volume. At Airborne we want to deliver consumer goods, wiring placing humans with drones at less than the cost of humans in high-pilocal space and convert this cash outflow to a major cash swing flow hence leading to a completely new revenue stream. This problem is just not limited to food industry but spans along multiple industries such as MetX-Lash-Heltech which is nothing but medicine delivery, e-commerce for our logistics, D2C businesses and retail industry globally. I am looking forward to learn more about start-up finance, talent acquisition and to curate from your experiences at YC. Now this was the why and I believe that you guys must be curious to know more about how exactly and with what. So yeah let's meet at the interview now. I am excited."
Canscr's Application Video for YC Winter 2023,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfSmxEtq8Mc," Hi I see this is Dr Vishal, I am the CEO and founder of Kanskar. I will just complete my post-graduation in general search from Ames, New Delhi. At Kanskar we are building a affordable, accessible healthcare solution aimed at cancer care for the middle-class population of India. The reason or motivation for building this startup is that when I tried to find a screening center back home for my parents it was too difficult to find a survivor and I had to call them back to New Delhi to get screened for cancer and it's too difficult since most of the recommended screening intervals are 6 monthly or 3 monthly. And to address this we have made comprehensive cancer care packages which are aimed at both lifestyle interventions as well as cancer screening at the specified intervals. So we are hoping you to join us in our fight against cancer. Thank you."

Hokart - Y Combinator Application Video (YC summer 2022),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qINbeTL-Ygw," Hi, I am Akanksha. I am Mangat. I am Kavita. And we are building a hookart, a B2B2C marketplace for 10 million street food vendors. Street food in India is a 13 billion dollar market. With more than 65% Indians love eating on the street. Food delivery is expected to grow at 30% year on year in the country. However, street food vendors are not able to participate in online commerce as they do not have a platform to do so. As a result, you do lack of visibility, high quality raw materials and access to microfinance. Street food vendors are not able to compete with restaurants and grow their business. Hookart is bridging this gap by connecting street food vendors with consumers in a fun and exciting way. Indians are still hesitant of buying food online as they do not trust the source of production. To build this trust, we enable food influencers to create and share food experiences through short videos. This enables consumers to discover the right options and buy through the trusted network. Additionally, influencers directly earn commissions by promoting food through Hookart. Currently, we have about 100 street vendors operating with us. Our monthly GME is growing at 60% per month. Currently, it stands at 5600 dollars. Some vendors have even seen a revenue growth of up to 300% and we've just launched our mobile app on Claystore. With our prior experience in running a cloud kitchen chain and building tech products, we are well-placed as a team to put street food on the digital map of India. Come join us as we reimagine the waste food is born in India. Thank you."

Midly Team YC summer 2022 application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUlXSNt7sVc," Hi everyone, in this video we want to talk about the people. I'm Francesco Erenheim and I'm the CEO of MyDrip. I've been working in the Italian startup industry for the last seven years. And now I'm the innovation advisor for Bicocca University. So I keep my mind fresh, interacting with the young students every week. And my name is Daniel. I'm a digital product designer. I have been doing this for the last five years of my life now, or almost for the last five years. And I'm a bit north, I know a bit of code. And that's why I really enjoy working with the devs to make the product come to life. And what else can I say? I think that the team perfectly balanced each other because Francesco's weaknesses are my strength and vice versa. So he perfectly balanced each other. We also have another co-founder that who is a Yassin Bial. He has less than 10% of equity and he's been working in the Italian music industry since he was 14. I think that, together we have all the perfect feature to succeed. Yes, we really enjoy doing this."
Y Combinator Application S18: Grubyr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rijv7DGAyoo," Hello, I'm Rob. Hi, I'm Bobby. And I'm Bargav, and we're Grover. And we're a mobile platform for businesses to post deals for food that they would otherwise throw away. Consumers can go on our app and then purchase those deals at a discounted price directly. Last summer we noticed this problem at local pizza joints in our suburban town late at night. We would see that the extra pizza slices that they're selling to consumers weren't being sold, and then otherwise just ended up being thrown away. We're almost done with our prototype. And once we are, consumers will be able to enjoy a seamless method bringing the best local food deals. Well, businesses will be able to maximize their profits. Hi, I'm Andrew Hohl. And I'm Evan. And so a little bit about our pricing model is that we're going to be using both a subscription fee along with the Royalty fee. There will be a monthly subscription fee, and then the Royalty fee will be a small portion of all the sales of the restaurants. Grover currently has investor interests. On top of that, we also have a landing page with over 100 sign-ups. Yeah. And so some plans for the future are, we hope to start with the smaller, more local restaurants, but then we hope to expand to more of the chains and even possibly grocery stores. We're going to take Grover to the next level."
Foodyours (YC S21) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9vLkvD3ctM," Haiya, Maya. Haiya, Steve. Haiya, Venu. Awe, the founders of Fudeos. Africans love homemade food. And for many professionals in Africa, make thin cooking with their business cadres is a huge challenge. Restaurants are so expensive, they don't make custom orders. And finally, there is a high unemployment rate in Africa. In order to solve this problem, we created a platform where one employee deutes and the employee deutes and third-man parents can sell homemade food. Fudeos is a schedule service, which allows customers to order from vendors in their locality. So one of the solutions we are providing is to help vendors make money, the great convenience for customers and provide employment in society. Finally, our platform also helps to provide trust between customers and vendors. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
YC Summer 2017 - RiskBazaar application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6l2YO3Z7_Q," Hi, we're combinator. I'm Michael from Riscazar and I bet you I'll be able to pop this ball in. You lost that one, Michael, mate. That's just one example of the infinite number of contract, so you'll be able to empty into on Riscazar. You'll be able to facilitate wages such as that previous one, but also more interestingly, here to appear and show it to contract between two individuals and two entities. We've previously applied twice to a combinator and haven't got through to the interview stage or in fact received any feedback. So let us know what your thoughts are on blockchain. Is it an extra trillion dollar industry or is it more important that we start paying people because they can't build careers and companies in a future AI economy?"
Sylus AI (YC W24) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHQj1FopZDs," Hey YC, it's nice to meet you. My name is Anirut Vardamani and I'm the technical co-founder of Silas AI. So at my last internship I was really fortunate enough to work with some of the latest AI and elementals like Lang Chene as well as OpenEAS GPT models. And I've recently read this amazing fact stating that if you can help someone save an hour per day that would be like helping them save 15 days in a calendar year. And by the way my idea was also inspired by Ironman's Jarvis character. So what is Silas AI? So Silas AI is like a smart AI agent where the user would come into the application chat with it and it would then decide like which action to take. So the user can choose between Outlook, Notion, Amazon and all the other third-party apps. So as we speak my idea is being tested by around 10 to 15 users and once I receive feedback from them I plan on iterating and improving the product. By the way my idea also got approved by Microsoft for startups and it's also a part of it right now. Thank you very much."
YC Application Summer 2014 Verni,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeQ7yfuEfek," Hi, I'm Robin and I'd like to introduce you to Verne. Verne is a web app that enables all artists to turn their space, whether it's their apartments, their studios, or their garages into geolocated galleries for anybody to visit. It's open source curation for artists. Artists continue to have a tough, they can either find galleries to represent them or they could try to upload their artwork online where usually gets swallowed among thousands. I believe art should be discovered and seen up close. And with Verne, artists have the ability to get people as close to their art as possible in their galleries, in their context. For art lovers, it's a great way to rediscover their neighborhoods, to find all the hidden talent that's been kept for so long. I'm always curious to find out what is behind world walls, walking down any street, looking up at the buildings. And with Verne, I have the option to do that now. A little about myself, I come from a creative background as a designer and animator. I then put my job about two years ago to pursue startup idea I had. That failed partly to the fact that I didn't know how to code. So I shelved that project, spent the last six months learning how to code, and I'm here to do it again, but better. I'm a big fan of using our online resources to empower us offline. And I believe Verne is a great way to do that through art. Thank you."

Mage (formerly Snapcardster) (YC W19) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC4i1OcAzzU," My name is Pierre, I'm the ECO and co-founder of SnapCards. And I'm Martin, I'm the CTO and co-founder. SnapCards is the first only one app for Magic players. Magic is the best game in the universe, period. It's a trading card game, so you have a bunch of cards, like a box of cards, or thousands of cards. And you don't know what the price is, and which cards you own, and who's going to buy them. So we've built an app for Magic that scans the card, recognizes the image, and tells you what the price is, and who's going to buy it. The scanner is based on a neural network. I developed it in my vegetable thesis, and currently it's scanned over 1 million cards. And I'm leaving a team of seven developers right now in Germany, and we just hit our 20,000 users per day. The app is going great, we want to go to San Francisco, because we think that the US market is the way to go, and we've just went there for two weeks, and it's just incredible to be part of that environment. So see you in San Francisco, bye bye."

Toastr YC Application Summer 2022,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfH2WxW6tpY," Hi, I'm Lauren. Hey, I'm Priti, and I'm Robert. And we're Team Toaster. As active real estate investors, we've noticed a growing need in the rental space. We've seen that our residents will go out of their way to live at a place with great management. But they want to leave their feedback. The problem is nobody likes leaving reviews, and we think Toaster is solved for that problem. Imagine a Yelp meets Instagram. Toaster allows people to leave interactive social reviews with their friends or family or complete strangers. Toaster finds out exactly how your apartment operates. We've built a prototype and react native, and have plans to roll out a beta test with friends and family and may. Alright, White Sea, you gotta get out of here. Cheers or roast, you decide to toast.

YC 2013 Summer Application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gppmU2mwxZA," Hi, my name is Abraham and this is Ethan. And the problem we're currently trying to solve is that there's no easy way to easily find and purchase used car parts on the internet. Essentially what we're doing right now is building a web platform where the user can instantly find used car parts locally or nationally as well as purchase them. Since they're trying to create an Amazon for used car parts. So right now the current systems that are out there, they're not user friendly and all. As well as they have really, really poor presentation which makes it complicated for the user to actually find and in some cases not even be able to purchase parts. And then from the business end, the cost for current systems is very prohibitive. They usually require very steep upper and cost for an expensive monthly fee. In addition, they have very restrictive, very specific and how companies can manage their inventory and they use the required large change on the back end for the business. Yeah, so there's actually about only 1% of salvagers out there that are currently using these systems. And so what we're trying to do is for the user end, we want to be our web platform is currently trying to first of all provide instant results. No wait, second is being having the ability to purchase them instantly from the site. Third, the presentation is not confusing as well as a user feedback system so that customers can feel more comfortable into purchasing certain parts as well as looking parts and certain salvage yards. And then on the business end, we plan to make it free to join and free to upload data. And we'll just charge us a small percentage drop of each transaction. And in addition, we plan to provide an on-intrusive way for a business to interact with, to upload their data and interact with their system. Yeah, I mean, there's currently a lot of up, for maintenance salvagers, it's not cheap. You know, there's already currently a lot of upkeep costs. And so in our way, it's going to pretty much provide another avenue of income without hurting the current business practices. So yeah, that's exactly, this is a business that we're trying to run."

So me and Praveen we have been childhood friends and we share the same enthusiasm and the common idea of just to build new things. So we are giving it a shot with 8Shirts. Together we are building a marketplace for startups where founders can launch and list their products to get their first 100-1000 customers. Beat technology startups are fast-moving consumer goods. So you may ask why did we build 8Shirts? So as a second time founder we understand how hard it is to get the first set of customers when we don't have proper distribution channels. So we want to solve this problem for founders across the country by creating the right distribution for them. So but you may ask how can we attract customers to our website? So we are trying to build a knowledge base of all the Fortune 500 companies and the new startups that are coming in. And how did they bring in the first set of customers? Basically building an encyclopedia of new startups. And companies. So to put it across simply we want to be the Wikipedia for case studies."
gloudio YC application video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN1F1KxxWM," Hi I'm John. I'm Claire. I'm Jabid. And we're here to tell you about Gladio. Gladio is a mobile app for audio guides. We're fixing the issue of audio guides being spread across a huge range of sources. So apparently if you want to go on a walk into it, if you want to see a museum, you have to download an app from 10 different places, you'll have to hire a console with an horrible headphone. It's generally a really inefficient fragmented system and it doesn't often cover the sites that you want to go to and make your own explore. We aim to make the user experience of audio guides better by aggregating all of the audio that is out there onto our app-based platform. Any audio guide that you would wish to have for any place that you visit, you'll be able to access through our app. The content will consist of guides to use ourselves, guides produced by their pasties, sites, and also user-led content. In addition to that, the content will be geo-tagged. So our app will suggest to use various guides that they can listen to as they go exploring wherever they are. We want to disrupt the audio guide market as it stands today. It's fragmented, it's poor quality, and it's not user-friendly. We want to change that. Thank you for listening and we hope to see you soon."

Hi, I'm Rachel Somen-Jentalk and I'm the UX-Y designer for Lipin. Hi, I'm Michelle Bonan and I'm the Public Relations Manager of Lipin. Lipin is a tool for translating ideas into projects. For example, you have an idea for a new cartoon show. The project is the new cartoon show and the show needs a main character. Our main character is represented as an object which you add to the project. Instead of writing out a large portion of text to flesh out the character's background, create another object representing the hometown of our main character. Simply link the two objects within Lipin and you have now successfully created a network of objects within your project. The new cartoon show idea you just came up with. But Lipin can be used in any situation that requires organization of thought. As long as you have access to the internet, you have access to your Lipin account. Lipin grew out of a practical need to provide a documentation system for created people and Lipin will solve this need. Lipin, all your documentation in one place."

I trained as a physician but from 2019 I started searching on the use of AI in healthcare through various projects like disease detection, the use of computer vision but other than that I really love working out. I believe everyone in the world needs to stay healthy but out of this seven billion market is a small percentage of people who are just like me willing to take to do whatever it takes to stay fit, stay motivated and are looking for something different, something exciting, something that actually works.

YC Summer 2017 application video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jy9MCd2lqE," My combinator, what's up? I'm Brandon Lee. I am the founder of Kusta. Kusta is a real estate data and information platform and peer-to-peer marketplace for buyers and sellers to completely sell their homes online without the hell with an agent. As it is right now there is no real technology for home buyers and sellers. There's Sillo which is a media company for real estate agents and then the other alternative is working with agents which is you work on their process, you call them up, they listed somewhere and then they tell you what offers you get over the phone. In the platform you basically sellers can go on, they can search their home, they can find all of my other statistics about their home and also comparable sales. They can send a listing price, they then listed on the platform. We drive, we market it for them, we drive traffic for them, buyers can go on, they can search properties, they can make offers on properties and then the buyers and sellers can negotiate on the actual price. Once the price is agreed upon, send a contract and they send it as well. So it's the end-to-end real estate process. Just a little bit about where the company is at right now. We've been MVP-built and we are in week five of a 14-week sprint to complete beta version of the product and a little bit about me. I have a number of companies that started and exited out of successfully and last was a data products for the mortgage industry company. MVP co-founder is another one of the companies that I founded which is a services company in India and he's an elite technologist there and that's why he's not here because he's in India. But he will be moving here shortly and working full-time on the product. That's it, thanks a lot, have a good one."
YC Winter 2021 BBOOK Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwp69z8vAVc," Hi, my name is Ryan Sam and I'm the founder of BeeBook. BeeBook is a mobile app to create your social events with your friends. The reason why I'm building this is because I want to provide an alternative to social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, which studies have shown is increasing feelings of loneliness and depression. BeeBook creates real and personal experiences with your friends, which lowers feelings of loneliness and increases happiness along with other great benefits. It's actually quite personal for me. When I first started coding three years ago, I was hanging out with a bad group of friends. I knew it would be beneficial for me to stop hanging out with that group of people. In doing so, I was gonna have to lose all my friends. I was very lonely at the time and I wish there was an app where I can meet new people and I knew I was gonna be the one that had to build it. And here I am. Anyways, I really want to be a part of the once-in-twentieth 21 badge and I hope to hear from you guys soon. Thank you."

We help collectors find one another, explore each other's collections and propose trades to one another to exchange shoes, almost like you would with players and fantasy sports. Yep, and being sneaker heads ourselves, we knew this was already going on in person, but there was no digital platform to do that. We decided to test this concept out on Instagram last year and got instant reception. We have repeat paying customers already and we facilitated trades paying 46 states already. Yeah, and when we saw that level of just excitement from the Instagram, we knew it was time to go ahead and build this into an actual product.

BarHop (YC W23) application video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kNOjtoGXM," Hi, my name is Victor. I previously founded Coco, a wide-combinator-backed blockchain company, and two months ago I launched BarHop, a platform that offers bar hopping events every night. And the reason I did so is because sometimes we want to have a fun night out, but we don't have friends to go out with. Maybe we're traveling or we just move to a new city and don't know anyone there. Maybe your friends are just busy and can go out or we just want to make new friends. And let's admit it, we have all been there. Well, not anymore. Meet the bar hop. For only $20 a ticket, you get to be in real life with a really cool group of people, both locals and internationals, and explore the best dance bars in town together, while getting access to special deals such as free trains, free shots, discounts, and keeping the lines at bars. We launched two months ago here in Brooklyn, New York, and so far I have personally hosted more than 14 bar hop events for more than 80 bar hoppers, meaning customers, and we have made $1,600 in revenue. We have established partnerships with two bars here in Brooklyn, where they give us free drinks in exchange for us bringing people to their businesses. We're conquering New York. And next, we will become a platform that people from all over the world will use to meet other people in a very friendly non-opera environment while having a great time and saving money. And we really look forward to having why combinators joining us in this journey. Thank you."

I'm Rxin and I'm currently 16 years old studying at Hong Kong International School. Over the recent years, I've been participating in many hackathons and a 15 international hackathons. And currently, I'm about to launch my first daughter called Video Fest. So, I've been editing videos for school and YouTube and I've been using video editing to show us until we premiere pro and the video is resolved. And I've always realized that per video is taking me hours to edit the videos and sometimes as a nightmare to edit the videos because of the complexity of these two. So therefore, I realized that there is a pretty high learning curve for people who don't know how to edit videos to edit high quality videos. And that is the problem I want to solve with Video Fest. So, Video Fest is an online video editor that allows you to create and edit high quality videos in the easiest way possible. I've created some videos with Video Fest and I realized that it's taken so much less time to create videos of high quality. And I believe YC will help me kick start the launch for Video Fest. Thank you very much for considering my application."

I'm a UX and product designer and I've been a designer for over ten years. I'm building Matuski because the current structure for voting in competitions, sidelines, the organisers. The status quo is ineffective and is on duly skewed in favour of the service providers which have a telecoast. They take roughly 75% of the revenue and voting is limited to only their customers. Now, we solve this problem because Matuski is accessible to everybody. Also, organisers have much better margins because Matuski takes a very small percentage and we ensure faster payout. Also, everybody from big tickets competitions like Big Brother Nigeria or Nigerian Idol, to the smaller ones like Talent Hontor, online challenges, why small businesses or upcoming ads can't all utilise Matuski to monetize their campaigns. And the super cool thing about Matuski is that we're opening up in a new and uncontested market space in West Africa. It's easy to use and you can get your campaigns like operating in less than five minutes. That's it. That's all. Thanks guys. Thank you."

I'm Jack, a second year econ major in UChicago. I'm Jonathan, a second year econ major at UChicago. And where are the founders of pollinate? Most college students at one time are another struggle with procrastination, ourselves included. And we see this as the number one problem facing students today. So our goal of pollinate is to provide a solution to the struggling students. Yeah, last quarter it got so bad for me that I needed to actually solicit other students to study with me so that I could defeat procrastination. And I met with around 20 other students individually over Zoom. And afterwards other students would come up to me and say, Jack, this was the most productive study time I've had on a quarter. With this information in mind, we created a site that allows other people, other UChicago students, to meet randomly to study. Right now we don't have any users and we don't have any revenue, but we're excited to keep working on this problem.

YC Summer 2016 Application - brainswole,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7J0owWBfOs," Hello, my name is Neil Barnasom and a month ago I created a website called brandswoll.com with the aim that you can do math problems within your own generated data. So right now I have it you can learn a statistics problems with your Fitbit data and your League of Legends data. So you go on there and it'll create problems. You can figure out what's the mean of your average kills and League of Legends over your average calories burned or it's just stuff like that and I'd like to further expand it to other math content concepts and other data providers as well. So if you ever want to win math then I'll just learn it within your own contacts and make it all that much more compelling to learn. All the while it'll keep track of your progress so you can show your teachers and whatnot that how competitive you are. So thanks."

YC S2023 Application Video (SimpL),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNWMpXB2fbE," Hi teacher me, I am Nikolom, founder of Simple. Talking to recruiters and universities and job seekers we found out how time consuming the use of PDF format for curriculums is they are hard to create, they're hard to update, they're hard to apply with, in fact many companies ask you to rewrite your entire experiences just to have a clear idea of your profile. And if they don't do this, the recruiter will have to read hundreds of thousands of PDF based curriculums just to know if the applicant has the requirements for the job. So what we're creating is an app where the student can create a digital curriculum, so blockchain based CV. And with this he will be able to easily create a CV, update it, keep it updated and apply for jobs. And the recruiter of course will see a profile and not a document, so he will be able to filter the profiles, see if they have the requirements, create automated recruitment processes and much more."

I started TUS in 2015 to give people the best place to write things down privately. But then we able to share those things publicly from the same place. We've since temporarily removed TUS social just to focus on helping people remember things. Things are more than just notes. Things can be your thoughts, memories, ideas, or something as simple as coupon codes. Other apps focus too heavily on note taking and productivity and are not organized enough for the capturing of individual things.

And together we're the co-founders of Shupi and we almost have 10 years of work experience at Social Media startups. Social messaging platforms like WhatsApp have massive sales potential. However, businesses lack information about social media users' real-life identities and they struggle to track the conversion of their social messaging efforts.

Shupi transforms social messaging into a powerful sales channel and enables businesses to track social media users' buying behavior when they visit their website. This enables businesses to identify potential buyers on social conversations and retarget them via messaging in order to increase sales.

Now, the name of my company is Soul Hacker's Labs and what I'm trying to do is to literally hack into your souls to know exactly how you feel every time that you type something about a company, about a politician, about a product. And in order to do that, I came up with this magic algorithm that can detect 80 motions from text and it's fully multi-lingual. Now, I currently have English and Spanish and I'm working to add French, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Japanese. Now, what I want to do with this algorithm is to provide business intelligence to companies. Currently, most companies rely on those data aggregators that they can only tell you where your company is based on retreats and lags and stuff like that. Now, those numbers are good, but what I can do is even cooler. I can exactly tell you how customers feel about your company. I can tell you why they feel sad or happy or excited about your company. And I can't even tell you what they expect from you. Now, in order to reach more companies, I need your help. So, please, found me. Thank you."
Basil -- Y Combinator S14 Application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeuegIORWB8," Hi, I'm Mark. Hi, I'm Willie. And I'm Misha. We met a year ago in a senior design class when a doctor came and told us about an EMR, he wanted to take with him on medical mission trips. We thought it was a great idea and a year later we had a solid prototype. We had an awesome opportunity to take the app down to Haiti early 2014 with a group of surgeon providing care from UT Medical Center here in Knoxville. We used the app for patient intake, gathering medical histories and gathering some physical exam data. We also gave it to a group of dentists who were down there at the same time. At the end of both trips, we had roughly 150 patients in the system, which was really exciting. And we saw a lot of excitement around the project. So we really wanted to take a little one step further and put it in the hands of every doctor, charity, and mission group that's going to do these medical missions. We're really excited because if we can get the app out and then get the data back here, you know, we can get a bigger picture of what these places need and what we can provide for them."

YCombinator Application Video: imgix,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QunJMCoc0Qo," Hi, welcome to New York. My name is Chris Zacharias. I'm working on a project called Thumbprint. It is an imaging web service that allows people to manipulate and store images without requiring any sort of server libraries. It's really easy to upload and thumbnail images or apply filters like YouTube, Instagram, and stuff like that. It really started out as a passion project for me, just sort of I left YouTube and wanted to work on more graphics oriented stuff. And it solves a problem that we used to have a lot, which was we used to serve about 30% more image data than we actually had to in order to support thumbnails on youtube.com. Because nobody wanted to build the infrastructure to actually clip them down and get them to the right size. So I built basically that system. And it's just me at the moment. I've done all the coding, the scaling, operations, and copywriting into the design work, all that fun stuff. And I just recently pushed at the beta, included in invite on my application. Now that I've actually have it out and can show people, I'm starting to get a lot more interested from some of my fellow engineers. And I'm starting to bring people in to help me. So it's been pretty fun so far. Excited to hear if you guys are interested in that. Thanks."
Andrew Parks YC W2018 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq7an2LsZTo," Hi, I'm Andrew Parks. I'm the founder of a mobile oil change solution. I'm a mechanical engineer, a logistics engineer, and a startup veteran. The idea came about basically a friend and I talking about how much of a pain it was to go into oil change and that we never do it on time. Why is that? It's not because the price, it's simply you don't want to go do it. So the solution is to bring it to you. This isn't Uber for X. This isn't punch an app and get an oil change. This is a thoughtful solution that starts with the customer and asks what do they want? What is the quality? What is the expectation for service? This is to make it as seamless as possible and then only augment with technology on an as needed basis. Start with the customer, start with the solution, and then work to the technology from there. I'm really excited to work on this and build something that people want."

Hi, I am Pranit, I am major in Kim Kalshans and Community. It's Sahara where we are building Amazon off-limits, there are some hundred retailers. Me and my brother have been working on this problem for past six months. This was started because when our parents started our pharmaceuticals, they were not pandemic. The problems we faced were finding these initial customers and building their recurring customer base. So we spoke with hundreds of small businesses owners like us. They had a common problem. So this common problem is faced by millions of other businesses around the globe. So we are addressing this problem using our web-by-mower platforms. Let's assume a customer orders a product from this store using our platform. We will deliver the product using our network of Google workers. So we want to make Sahara go to platform for the business. So government of India Prime Minister Modi supported in our journey. We have about six or three daily empty users. We are generating revenue, customers, lovers and our products. So CSC is zero. So this is the store we are onboarding right now. This is 12 a.m. in the morning. So this is Sahara. Thank you."
YCombinator (YC W2018) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXKcHwf0jjY," Hello, my name is Sigor. And my name is Sieta. And we are going to create an online platform for people who have a passion for good cooking and would like to share their dishes. And for fans of good cooking, we like either time or desire to cook. The idea is to dispense people with the necessity of cooking, but to provide them with various nutritious and awesome food, including homemade dishes. One of the options is to allow the client to come to an agreement with one or two cooks, so the director will prepare different meals for a couple of days. The cooks and the customers, the turnover terms, and in a few days they can get the touch again and arrange a new deal. So, this is a new lifestyle and it's only one of the range of possible construct scenarios available on the site. We have said our personal, creating this super quality product. So we would love you to become our allies. Thank you. Thank you."

Slip (YC S21) Application Video - Update: We were accepted to YC!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve6cQTtY7aM," Hey, I'm Keneth and I'm the founder of Slipp. Slipp's a platform where developers can build and sell interactive programming courses and earn money from their knowledge. I built Slipp because I made my own programming course that topped them fundamentals. I built and launched it in three days and I made $10,000 in my first month. I was only able to do this because I leveraged a ton of code from a previous project that had all the authentication, code execution, and all that setup in it. So I decided to abstract that platform away and let other developers do the same. I launched last week and I have 26 paid subscribers. A couple of authors have already released courses and earned money on the platform. A total of $400 have been sold in the first week. There's a lot of pool from the market. Developers seem very keen to earn money from their own audience and it's been extremely fun building Slipp. I think Slipp could have a really huge future as being the number one platform for developers to earn money from their programming knowledge. Thanks, YC."

Hello I say Sankel Thessai, co-founder and chief executive officer, Ed Sensei. So Ed Sensei, we are on our mission to help kids, those who are thriving in today's fast pace and digital stress outward. So remember our childhood view, we used to go outside and play, with some friendship, learn some valuable likes and among the way. But kids today are more indulged in the screen, lacking some emotional and social growth and also under huge academic pressure. So that's where Sensei comes in. We are building enough fun and a gamified platform that teaches kids about social emotion and life skills. By life skills we mean emotional intelligence, ethical decision making, interpersonal skills and many more. We are keeping the platform engaging by creating interactive activities, relatable challenges and gamified features where kids learn to play and the parent gets the insight of their children's growth.

RAC is a website where you can buy and sell used goods. When you want something, all you need to do is pay and go deliver to you. We launched last week in San Francisco. We got 16 people to buy items, four of them have come back and bought even more. Facebook Marketplace has a billion users. Our average spend per customer is $7.5. If we maintain this our market opportunity is $7.5 billion. We're starting with big items like furniture that people can't really move around on Facebook Marketplace. But we're having all sorts of other items on our website and we're doing the deliveries ourselves. Our unique insight is that customers want one platform with payment customer service delivery all built into one. They don't want a chat interface where they have to figure out all the logistics of getting a simple item like a couch. Exactly. See you soon, YC. Thanks, YC."

Y-Combinator Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUWbgNWUBLA, I'm Darrell Harris. For the past five years I've devoted much of my professional career to providing support and services for individuals with disabilities. My mission has been to provide the highest quality of life for everyone despite their physical limitations. One of the biggest barriers to this is the lack of on-demand transportation for individuals who use wheelchairs and other ambulatory assistant devices. That's why I started Movemo. The first on-demand ride sharing service specifically designed for people who require wheelchair accessible vehicles. The Movemo app is in development what a heart launch set for next spring. We are vetting a number of talented professionals for key C-suite positions and expect to have a full executive team by December. I'm applying for Y-combinator to gain valuable insight in hopes of making my dream of access and inclusion for everyone become a reality. See you in January.
Favour-YC S21 | Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr0-u85JjY," Hello, Hi, this is team Pover and we are working on an idea which is basically connecting the students who are in need of a favor to the students in their campus who could help them out. So basically the students who are helping others are getting rewards in terms of discount coupons that they could really match their local stores. So we have been working since past two months in our campus and we have successfully gathered around 180 plus students on our platform which mainly resides in three campus hostels of our campus I do. We are also playing a weighted IT Root Key where we have been loaded a working space where we are working on our idea of how we can improve that. Also we are having some leadership from various harmonies who are giving some value or interest on our idea. We have successfully collaborated with 14 nearby stores who are providing us the discount coupons which we are further providing as rewards for every competitive they have. We hope that we get selected in this summer school program. Hope to see you soon. Bye."
DoorDash’s Application Video for YC in 2013,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SfvwFQzqPkA," After over a hundred interviews, we came across a really interesting problem with small business restaurants and an area like this. How about though? Yeah, so it turns out restaurants in Palo Alto don't deliver even though they really want it, but they can't afford it. But their consumers are craving for it, but the places that the consumers love just can't deliver. And we also found out about these delivery drivers, about a ton of spare time, and they all want to earn extra cash during that downtime. So that's when we built an initial product, Palo Alto Delivery.com. And the four of us actually started off as delivery drivers. And over time we hired more, that'd be great. And our first month of launch, with not much marketing, we got over 150 paid customers in the Palo Alto area. It was really awesome. Freaking love it. Two days ago, I'm in New York showing Goldman Sachs what Mannect did. The first year, we did 28 Mannects. And this year, in the first six months, we've done 27,000 completed Mannects. That's how stuff starts. And obviously we all know about DoorDash. So congratulations to these guys."

UnderWing YC W21 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jQAb7Wq4n0," Anytime. Hey Brian. Eric. Hope you're staying healthy and safe. This is our YC application video and we wanted to tell them a little bit about why we're building underwing and how it is going to solve people's problems. Yeah. So really quickly a little bit about myself. I'm a software engineer by trade. I've been working in this industry for a little over six years now and that actually said was well with why we're building underwing. So I graduated college 2013 and I graduated with a public health degree and I wanted to get into tech but I didn't know how. And I just remember wishing I knew people who had gone down this path before and having some medium to contact and and really figure out more about this this journey. And so for me that's that's the reason why I want to build this is to help myself six years ago get on the path a little bit easier. Yeah. It couldn't have said any better Brian. I mean same way as a first generation immigrant you are only given a few options to succeed. And if I had known what I know now and half the people that I was connected to back in the day I would have found myself a lot happier, less anxious and a lot more successful. And the problem that underwing is aiming to solve is exactly that. Connecting advice hungry professionals or students to industry veterans and professionals who are there to shepherd them through whatever they're going through. We want people to be inspired more encouraged more frequently and be motivated to get the most out of their lives through these mentorships. And so that is underwing. Brian is the CTO and I'm the CEO and we're looking to hear back from you soon. Thanks."
PNL YC Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AoNCQbHTRo," Hi guys, my name is Hassan. I'm a junior at GBC pursuing a drug game physics and economics on a full scholarship. Hard option, opportunity work with Fortune and the company and also some tech startup. Hi guys, I'm Harleys, a computer engineering, also on a full scholarship. In the past I've been, I've been in right by Google and I've got my ZNASA. Now we came up with the idea of pre-interesting. We actually started in the cloud and then when the cross started asking us some random questions and we started getting that mobile phone to search. What became across was like laundry list of like answers, but like, it was like very difficult to find the right answer and the precise answer. It was like a time couldn't process very inefficient. And we started thinking how can we start, how can we solve this problem and this was just the starting point. So we came up with an idea to create a hybrid of an answer engine and a search engine for mobile devices that would give users concise information, tailored according to their needs. This would be done using five basic fundamentals, namely, personalization which would understand the user, semantic search, which would add context to your search, summarization, one page display and big data analytics which would improvise the search with time. One of the main features of first search engine is like the step-by-step approach for them, but you want to book travel to your flagship, you go, that's the first search you should do, once you do that, the next thing you tell you is like, it will optimize the flight to to calling the price and stuff like that. Second thing will be hotel, third thing like where you can eat, all like places you should visit while you're at those places. All that different between us and all of the search engines is that while all of the search engines focus on giving you all the information that's out there, they give you summarized information so that you don't need to go on different links and find out what you're looking for. We've also been part of like a little, accelerated plan with UBC which allowed us to make really good connections with investors and also like understand the customer needs and thank you so much for listening to us and we look forward to speaking to you in person. Thank you."
Advizion's YC S25 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H-sT5Sp4cQ," Hey, why see I'm a mirror. I did data science and machine learning at UC Berkeley and I'm also a senior software engineer and ML engineer here in Silicon Valley. And hi, I'm through some also ML engineer and Cal graduate in data science and machine learning today. We introducing at Vision and AI tool that fixed the 300 billion dollar problem of ads that nobody clicks. We found out e-commerce brands waste millions guessing what makes ads to work. We don't guess simply upload your ads or AI instantly shows what works and what grabs attention. Then it automatically optimize it for the higher engagement. No more trial and error just state of driven effective ads. So why combinators such expertise is our missing pieces. So let's stop the guesswork and tends to add into the profit engines. Thank you. I see."
Tribe (YC W20) Application video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv3eev4ZtJc, Hi my name is Dishon. I am the founder of Tribe. Tribe is a bit of a double threat. Tribe is essentially an open table like app for people-based businesses. Now when I say people-based businesses I mean anything from a yoga class to an amusement park concert to go-carting. Essentially basically anything where a group of people can get together and do a shared activity together. Tribe would be the platform that you can book that on or also find other people who like doing those same things that you like doing and maybe you'll get together and do those things together and forge new friendships and connections. For businesses Tribe is essentially open table. Tribe would charge businesses based on the bookings that they get and for users Tribe would be a meet-up app but with the business functionality at a premium. So by that I mean users could pay a little bit extra and get access to exclusive events with our partners based on their interests.

GDG YC S18 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2E6oAoOz6U," Hi, I'm Shiva, an architect based in Chennai, India, and I'm the founder and CEO of Green Design Group. Hi, I'm Sasi. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Green Design Group. I have a background in software security, and I'm currently based out of Boston. During my master's research at Penn State, I realized that much of the innovation in the energy industry in the US happens in either the carbon sequestration space or in the renewable space, which are only ways of managing the problem after it's happened. But the way of cutting it out of the source is to focus on reducing our energy consumption. And what we've done is look at the residential sector, which is actually the biggest consumer of energy in our country. And we've interviewed around a couple of hundred homeowners and tried to figure out why they wanted to live a more sustainable lifestyle and why they were unable to do so. And we have a basic workflow on our demo at Green Design Group. So we're currently on track to develop a much more robust pilot for user testing, and we're hoping to roll it out in a couple of states by the end of April. We truly believe in the idea that we're working on. We've spoken to a bunch of end users, we've identified a specific problem that they have, and we believe that the solution we are providing would bridge a gap in this market. We're hoping that YCC is the same way too. Thank you."
FINT YC(S20) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ3ONfYqiwQ," Hi, I'm Nambi. I'm Chua Te. I'm a river. And we are the co-founders of Fint. Fint is an impact investing platform for Africa. We allow investors to invest in loans for Africans and African businesses starting with Nigeria. Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa with about 200 million people and 37 million businesses. But in 2019 less than 2% of the population and businesses actually have access to credit which is ridiculous. So we tried solving this problem by building a B2C model where we allowed businesses and individuals access loans using our algorithm. But we were not scaling fast enough. Investors liked the idea but found the product to be too risky because of the poor data and weak collection infrastructure in the country. So it was evident that if we were going to solve this problem at scale we would have to focus on collections. So this past December we transitioned into a B2B2C model where we partnered with businesses to structure the low risk borrowing products for those businesses, their customers and stakeholders in their value chain who happened to be individuals and businesses as well. That allowed us scale much quicker and significantly significantly reduced risk. So over the past three months with our new B2B2C model we facilitated over 100,000 loans, valued at 1.7 million dollars across just four partners. Comparing that to 23 months of our B2C model that represents a 40,000% increase in the number of low-sacillitated and a 350% increase in the value of most facilitated. And so we are confident about our new approach. So we are scaling fast but with your help we believe that we can achieve the skill we require. So so Africa's trillion dollar credit problem. Thank you very much. See you. Thank you."
Jobgator  (YC W2018) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2koLjFgPeCs," Hi, my name is Hannah and I am the head of product at JobGator and a former startup recruiter. Hi, my name is Ben Gelb, CEO of JobGator. About a year ago, I was in this awful job. I was really frustrated. And I began to search for new jobs and apply for new jobs, but I was really frustrated because I wasn't hearing back from any of the recruiters. And so I kept applying and tweaked my resume, but still didn't hear back from anyone. And so I thought there might be a problem with me. Was there something wrong with me? Maybe I wasn't qualified? I was only 23 years old? No, it was actually a problem with the system. Recruiters use automated tracking systems to automatically break down candidates to see if they have the right words or not. And I didn't have the right words. I built a system that solves this problem. JobGator evaluates scores and then improves the resume prior to applying and tells you what you need to get the job. JobGator also suggests top jobs for you based on your profile. We are so excited to apply for Y Combinator and hope you love our application. Thank you."

YC Application.mp4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REl2gCjcyp4," Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm Eric. You're not the will. And we're applying to Y Combinator without an idea. We've known each other for about six and a half years, where we all met at the same fraternity at Cornell University, where we all started engineering. So Eric, why do you kick ass at startups? Well, I kick ass at startups because my computer science major and I worked at Microsoft for about four and a half years as a Windows phone developer. And I quit about five or six months ago too. Most times, let's go work on my own startups goals. So did you also do something with CrossFit? All right, yeah. So I was a gymnastics strength coach at CrossFit Gym. And pretty much I pitched on that entire program. And it was pretty much always waitlisted. So it was a pretty good success. What about you? Well, you got like the investors page. You got the laser market. I am a material science engineer and I used to work for a metal powder producing company called North American Oganists. And I developed a product that was relatively new for the company and I pitched the idea to our investors. And I raised $2.5 million for the project. And currently the project is developing or the currently the project is under production. So that was pretty neat. And during this time, I developed the website lasermarket.com which aims to connect companies in the laser industry. So Ryan, what about you? Yeah. So I've watched a few startups before. One was called Urban Dippity. It was a social networking site in Seattle where it focused on finding people with similar real world interests as you. And right now I'm working on a website called Tech Calling, which is about awesome jobs that tech industry. And I also spent two and a half years at a company called Concur Technologies where I was a full stack web developer. So yeah, we're applying to a wide combinator. We've worked together on stuff in the past and we're excited about me getting in the future. So thanks for watching our video."
Eat Together (YC W16 Application video),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq99ELl9wAg, Hello I see my name is Meloos and I am Abdullah and we are both the co-founders of Eat Together. So with Eat Together what we want to do is we want to connect people who are living alone to share their real time with each other over a group video chat. Sort of like having a Google Hang-Rounds while having lunch or dinner. So instead of having dinner alone what you can do is you can connect to the bunch of other people and pass the time with some great conversation. Now why do we think there is a market for this? Basically while doing a research we discovered that the food bloggers broadcasting themselves eat are already drawing millions of monthly viewers in South Korea. It seems that people do actually feel lonely if they are eating alone and have a desire to connect with other people which is where Eat Together comes in. We have this idea fairly recently so we don't have a prototype as of yet but since we both often get anything we can really build fast and handle a beta version now in about a month. We really hope we can get into the YC program so we can take Eat Together from just an idea to a high growth start. Thank you.

After over a hundred interviews we came across a really interesting problem with small business restaurants in an area like this Palo Alto. Yeah so it turns out restaurants in Palo Alto don't deliver even though they really want to but they can't afford it. But their consumers are craving for it but the places that the consumers love just can't deliver. And we also found out about these delivery drivers who had a ton of spare time and they all wanted an extra cash during that downtime. Right and so that's when we built an initial product Palo Alto Delivery.com. And how it worked is the customer goes to the website and places it online order that gets automatically sent to the restaurant. And then we as a dispatchers with some pretty neat routing and batching algorithms where I would have send the drivers efficiently to get the orders to the customers at a really fast time. Yeah and the four of us actually started off as delivery drivers. And over time we hired more as we grew. And in our first month of launch with not much marketing we got over 150 paying customers in the Palo Alto area which was really awesome. And from that we generated over $10,000 in sales."
Guava's Application Video for YC W24,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3neIFL54XU," How do I see I'm Joel Mills and I recently interned at a legal tech startup as a software developer. And I'm Aaron Mills. I previously worked at Amazon as a software development intern and recently dropped out my master's program at U of T. We're brothers and we've been working on projects together for our entire lives. Grocery prices are only getting more expensive. You know students, we understand the hassle of trying to use flyers and coupons to get the cheapest deals. It just doesn't work. That's why we're working on Guava. A mobile application that leverages crowdsourcing in order to provide the consumer with up-to-date data about grocery prices in the area. Unlike flyers and coupons, we have information about all the items and can let users know which nearby grocery stores have their grocery list at the cheapest prices. Our launch date is set throughout October 29. Currently we're in the later stages of developing our first MVP and look forward to launching soon. We believe that with transparent grocery prices, people can make more informed decisions in saved money. Thank you."
Ami (YC W22) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMr1Z_WaCSY," Hi, I'm Kunal. Hi, I'm Neil and we are the co-founders of Army. We have been in the family owned Iowa business for the last 35 years and making approximately 12,000 MRR to a traditional retail business model with no tax and literal user's financial papers. 80% of the Indian Iowa landscape is unorganized. Segment like this, keep more than 3,000 acres of inventory this way. This is a gap in the market, huge gap, almost 70% out of 550 million people in the country need I care. On top of that, quality and affordability doesn't go to the other so well to give them the affordability they need and the quality gains the grave. It requires an organized approach to be the world's top solution. The market is large, growing and right for disruption. Yeah, and to pivot from what we have been doing over the years, we decided to shift our focus to quality products and technology. Customer satisfaction in current market is as this satisfying as Trump's presidency. We want to build our customers trust by providing a curated list of quality eco-friendly products that they can buy or use flexible leasing option for highest affordability and satisfaction. To achieve that, we are building out a robust Ikea system to support prescriptions, IWA deliveries, inventory, transaction and telehealth to optimize our internal process and four wall margins as we drive through horizontal integration. Finalizing manufacturing units for quality product supply and logistics. Also, we are going fully digital with e-commerce and mobile application. Lastly, expanding our retail stores and existing as well as new markets. When doing all of that, we want to keep a customer-centric mindset. In the end, quality Ikea should be accessible to everyone. Thank you."

We're helping the product teams to understand what customers ask about the most and what problems are based on support tickets and sales goals. Yeah, and we worked on Huckathon projects before, but decided to start it together because I have a background in product management, worked on support automation, and saw the problem that existing approaches for taking support tickets don't actually solve the need of a product manager. It doesn't have the granularity in it, you know, the, for example, to relate what are the common questions after your large-sum feature. Yeah, currently we are building an analytical tools to aggregate all the conversation across the company and make it easy to categorize them and find the most common questions, issues and feedback. And we started just a month ago, talked with dozens of product managers, and it's identified an issue of knowledge transfer between sales and support in the product teams, especially in the grown V2V size companies. Yeah, currently we already built about 60% of MVP for taking requests from Zendesk. Another help desk here, I was in the future, obviously. Thank you. Would love to work forward on the tuition with you. Bye, I see."
Esoteric Y Combinator Application Video (Winter 2022),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHHYEu6g-c0," Hey, I see my name's Ed and I'm joined by my co-founders Alexa and James and we're the co-founders of each Terrick, a digital fashion closet and aggregator for Metabirds fashion. We're building a sterrick for the digital fashion market, which is one of the biggest growth spaces in fashion at the moment, but unfortunately one of the biggest problems with digital fashion at the moment is that the experience that's buying, so shopping for and experiencing digital fashion is actually quite painful. So we are building this esoteric to tackle the three biggest challenges that we currently see in the digital fashion space right now. The first one is fragmentation. Product is really scattered across multiple platforms like NFT marketplaces, games, and digital fashion retailers. Second problem that we see is navigation. There's no easy way to find the items that you're looking for that are aligned with your tastes. There's a lack of duration and there's a lack of filtering capabilities, which makes for a really dissatisfactory shopping experience. And then the last problem is organization. Ultimately, even once you've purchased your digital fashion items, it can be really difficult to store them to find them all in one place because while it just aren't set up like closets. And so even once you've completed your purchase, there are still pain points to the ultimate experience. An esoteric extreme lenses process by finding a single point where you can do all of your fashion metaverse needs. And a long-term ambition is to become the go-to place to buy and manage your digital fashion."
inspectX YC Application Video - Summer 2018,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4PC0I0Ejc," Hey, YC, my name is Frank Aseric and I'm the co-founder of InspectX along with Victor, my co-founder, who unfortunately can't be with me today because I'm on a study abroad in Switzerland and loving all the car culture over here. But anyway, our goal is to create a marketplace that connects used car buyers to expert mechanics for on-site pre-purchase inspections. And we've already done a great job of that so far. We've done 51 inspections, over $15,000 in revenue, and we have a great reputation amongst the Porsche and BMW enthusiast segments in the market. But ultimately, we're doing this because Victor and I love cars. We love helping people buy cars. And we both know that the most underserved need in the entire used car process is getting an inspection. So we want to use this inspection toe hold as a way also to build up kind of a turbo tax for used cars through which you can take all the steps that you need to take to buy any used car for sale across the internet. So we hope you see the same opportunity that we do here. Thanks so much."

Now have you ever wanted to take away your friends and then felt super guilty about those left over 15 or so containers that you had to throw away? Well we've created a reusable container system for convenience food to replace single-use plastics in a way that's super convenient and super easy for people. We've conducted numerous surveys as well and engaged with potential delivery partners in order to prove that there's a huge appetite in the market. The US food delivery market is estimated to be about 30 billion dollars. This is last year and this year is only expected to be higher. This is not only because of the COVID pandemic but it is a general trend that we're observing. We're relatively long to the UK and the US and that's why we'll be linked at White Communities, the perfect opportunity for us to grow fast enough and hit our numbers and hopefully help us change the way we think about packaging. We're going to change the world. Thank you."

"YCombinator application video Talky AI, Inc. W2018",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45fNbwNTcto," Haiwaikombinator, my name is Jean-Marine Krunziza, and I'm the founder of Tokyo AI. In Africa, mobile network operators are losing SMS and voice revenues every minute to all TT players such as WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Emo, and so on. But none of those mobile network operators are willing to innovate to find those all TT players. So, at Tokyo AI, we've built a platform that's going to allow those M&Os to offer video and voice calling and chat to their subscribers with that public internet. But we've also built a machine learning back end that's going to allow those M&Os to offer better advertisements to their subscribers for other companies that means more revenues for them. But we also know that in Africa, 70% of people don't actually have bank accounts, but at least they have a feature phone and a SIM card. So, we are going to use our platform to offer better mobile money service. We've already acquired our first client and we are set to launch in October 2017. We are looking to be accepted into your program and hopefully fund it so that we can grow our team and acquire more partners."
YC Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES07GqLBSfM," Hi, good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, my name is Kinzie. I'm the founder of Go Man. It's an app that allows realistic agencies to manage access to your listings remotely. What we're trying to do is to create a place where agents have an exclusive hub to share and request access remotely. The reason why I created this app is because I feel like we agent waste a lot of time doing repeatable processes. Showing a partner should be like 1, 2, 3. That's basically what we have to do to close a deal and make the living. We make money and permission. So going to pick up keys and drop a keys is just not a big part of what we need to be doing to maximize our target. So we're looking to use Dorman as that access hub to actually empower agents with the right tools to share the keys and hopefully close the espasite. Thank you."

Y Combinator Application Video - Summer 2022 Batch (YC S2022),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut5-h9Tq6WA," Hi, Dean. My name is Rajesh. I'm the founder of Question. Question is a mobile application that lets you connect with other users and ask any kind of question on chat. According to a research by Zaireo, we spend about 213 billion hours every year just on Google to search for information. That's right, 213 billion hours. The sad part is, even after spending so long, we still do not get answers to many of our questions. So let's take a step back and think about it. What if we have an app in our mobile phones where we can ask any kind of question and we would get answers instantly? So that's exactly what question we is all about. Prior to question, I was working as a program manager, managing multi-million dollar projects, working with companies like IBM, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland. Currently I'm working full-time in the question and I really look forward to collaborate with you all and fast-track this journey to making question a multi-billion dollar project. Thank you."

The two of us came together about six months ago to solve a problem in Web 3. We recently tweeted our company, so we've in out and talked to all the best three companies we could find. After over 60 interviews, we kept coming across the same problem. It turns out businesses don't convert their existing contracts into smart contracts, even though they really want to because it's too expensive manual and complicated. We also found that these smart contracts don't connect to obtain information, which makes them less useful. We're currently creating an MVP where a person can go to our website and upload any real world contract, then we automatically convert that into a smart contract. We're going to launch our MVP by next week. Talk to you soon, YC."
How to hack the YC application [startups],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXYI1niJiyU," Hi guys, I'm Ahana and welcome back to my channel. Now in today's video, I'm going to be sharing my top tips for the YC application. If that sounds good to you, then keep on watching. Before I jump into this video, I want to give my usual disclaimer that I'm not affiliated with nor represent YC and all thoughts in this video are totally my own. And I'll also caveat this video by disposing that I'm not involved in any way in the YC admissions process. But over the last couple of weeks, a lot of you have been sharing your YC applications with me to review. As someone who's gone through YC myself, I of course have submitted my own application and having gone through so many other people's applications in the past couple of weeks. I started to notice a couple of common mistakes that people would make and equally there were some things that really made certain applications stand out and I figured I'd share that in this video. So first, I'm going to talk about the five common mistakes that I often see in the YC written application. And after that, I'll be sharing my top five tips when it comes to writing your own. So without further ado, let's dive right in. The first common mistake that I see a lot of the time is too many buzzwords. Oftentimes founders might think that using a lot of buzzwords might make them look super knowledgeable and like they really know the field that they're working in. But you have to put it in perspective. YC are going to be reading many, many, many applications at one go. And if they don't fully understand what the buzzword is or why it's been used and perhaps that could have been a more accurate descriptor of what you're doing, in most cases, using a buzzword is a big no-no. Just explain as clearly and as simply as you can. Along the same vein, stay away from acronyms. Remember that they're going to be reading hundreds and hundreds of applications and you want to make their job as easy as possible. So don't use buzzwords and don't use acronyms. The second common mistake that I often see is people are not providing a term calculation or if they do provide a term or how big this idea could get, the numbers just not big enough. Why combinator are the type of investors that want to invest in big ideas? So if you can prove that you have a good shot at building the next big company, that's been a boat really well for you on your application. However, if you do a basic revenue in the next year calculation, you're not necessarily giving yourself the best chance to show just how large this market is and how much money you can really make. So one, make sure you put a time calculation in there and two, ideally aimed for a market that's around a billion dollars or larger. The third common mistake I often see on YC applications is the founder that's filled out the application form has not actually answered the questions. Now of course this sounds obvious but I think you'd actually be surprised that sometimes it's easier to get sidetracked or talk about something else that you'd rather show off than answering the question that's being asked directly. This can kind of come across badly for two reasons. The first is that it can kind of make it seem like you can't articulate yourself clearly or answer questions directly. And the central reason is that sometimes when people don't give direct answers, it's because they're trying to cover something up or compensate. And that's not the impression that you want to give the person reading your application. The fourth common mistake is showing no evidence of hustle. And what I mean by that is oftentimes I'll see founders name drop their universities that they've gone to or the places that they've had jobs at. And while that's great and I guess there's some social proof in there, being great in a big company or having gone to a top university does not correlate to start up founder success. However, something that does correlate to success as a founder is showing that you're just the type of person that gets things done. And if that's what you can show a track record of in your application, that will actually make a far stronger application than someone who just name drops places that they've been to. If you do really want to talk about the places that you've worked with the universities that you attended, then say specifically what value you added and how you went above and beyond. Tell them something that not just anyone at that university or job could do. Show how you are different and were able to bring things to life. And the fifth and final common mistake that I see is people giving generic answers. Again, this application is about proving why you and your company should go through YC. And if you're going to give an answer to a question that anyone can give, that's not going to move the needle for. So even for questions on the application, like why you're applying to Y-combinator, give them an answer that not everyone could give. Why are you in a particularly special situation in which you can leverage their resources better than anyone else? Why are you the right team and why are you bringing your idea to the market at this specific time? I think YC even asks you to give a unique insight on the problem that you're solving. They are asking you to show what you know that not everyone does. And so many founders don't use that opportunity to show off their knowledge and their domain expertise. Use that question as an opportunity to really show off your unfair advantage on working on the problem that you're solving. Okay, so those are the five common mistakes that I often see on people's application. Now I'm going to walk you through some of my top tips. So the first one is to be clear and concise. I know I already alluded to this point by saying no buzzwords or acronyms, but I really want to drill home the point that the people in the YC admissions team are going to be reading so many applications. And some of the time the applications can be so poorly written that it's hard to even follow what the idea is, let alone the intricacies of the company. You want to make their job as easy as possible and that in turn will improve your chances. So be clear, be concise, don't use jargon, don't use acronyms, don't use buzzwords. A good way to think about it is if you have to explain what you're building to your grandma, how would you do that? It's certainly not about patronizing the reader or dumbing things down. It's just about finding the most effective way of communicating something. And oftentimes the simplest way of communicating an idea is the most powerful and the most straightforward. Also on this is the fact that you should never leave the reader not knowing where a statistic came from, or making them do extra maths to make an inference. You should give them all of the data upfront, say where it's come from, and make them do as little work as possible when actually reading your application. So many times I've seen founders go from saying how much they're charging their user to what their time is going to be, whereas they haven't actually said what the numbers in between in that calculation are, or shown that calculation upfront. I strongly encourage that you do that. My second top tip is to nail your one liner. At the very start of your application you get the opportunity to say what it is that you're building. And this is the first impression that YC are going to have of you and your company. The reason this question in particular is so important is that one, not only does it actually tell the reader what you're building, but two, it actually sets the tone for the rest of your application. If you've provided a really clear descriptive concise one liner, chances are the person reading your application is actually interested in inclined to learn more about it. However, the one liners that I've seen that just are totally undercriptive or using way too many complex jargon words, it's actually a lot less inviting to read those applications because you're just grappling trying to figure out what it actually is that this person's building. And sometimes you can get halfway through the application and it still might not be clear. So it's definitely worth putting time into your one liner and it's always an iterative process. Companies are always evolving their one liners and bouncing it off friends, families, mentors, advisors, and I would strongly encourage that you do the same. My third top tip is to really think deeply about your answers. Now again, this might sound like an obvious one and I really do not want this to come across as condescending. But having read through quite a few applications at this point, it really seems like sometimes founders writing the application, apporing all of this time and mental energy into the application, but not really putting that much time or thought into each individual answer. Again, this application is an opportunity for you to show off your intellect and how you think about problems. And that can be quite easily seen from the quality of an answer. Some answers can be quite surface level and superficial, whilst others go into much more detail and almost show how a person thinks. If they're a logical thinker, if they make data-driven decisions, all of these are things that you can weave into your story and weave into the application and make sure that you don't waste that opportunity. For each question, make sure you give a detailed and book through answer. Even for the ones that you think might not matter such as why you're applying to YC or where did you learn about us, show that you've gone above and beyond, show that you're a hustler and you like to learn information and act on it. My fourth top tip is to make sure you highlight your traction and achievements. Numbers are really hard to argue with and if you have a proven track record of delivering and particularly delivering in a short amount of time, these are the kind of indicators that YCC is very positive and I think for most companies that are able to demonstrate having achieved something. One of the hardest parts of being a startup founder is just showing up and getting things done. And if you can prove that you're able to do that and prove that you're able to do things in a short amount of time and quickly and make big decisions effectively when under time pressure. That again speaks really well for you as a founder. Make sure you highlight that in your application. And my fifth and final top tip is to ask a YC alumni to prove read your application before you submit it. Now I'm guilty. This is actually not something that I did when I was applying but I've already made a video about our application story so check that out if you haven't already. Long story short, I did not expect to get in whatsoever. And hence I didn't even think it was worth wasting other people's time reading our application. I don't think my own team members even read the application that I submitted to YC. But now on the other side is someone that's gone through the process. I've probably reviewed around 20 applications just this week alone. And the reason that I'm willing to put time into that is, you know, one I had fantastic people that helped me when I was on the other side of the coin. But secondly, I think just having seen more applications, I'm actually able to give decent feedback to the people whose applications I read. And most YC founders are pretty giving and all do the same thing for you. So don't be afraid to reach out of course as with everything in life, there will be some rejections. Also made a video on that. But do your part. Send messages on LinkedIn, send messages on Twitter. You just need a couple or even one person to say yes to give your application a look over and you'll be good to go. So that's all for this video. I hope this was helpful and if you have any other tips or questions about the online application process for YC, please feel free to leave your questions in the comments down below.

My company connects underrepresented software engineers and IT professionals to tech companies. I started my career working at a local startup. There I was responsible for growing the team and my job was to make sure that we found more people to actively join our team. I looked near and far and I wanted to make sure that we gave these opportunities to people that would really appreciate it. People that were first in their family to go to college, people that were first generation Americans. As they went through our interview process, we hear comments like, oh, they're not the right fit. They don't have the right technical capabilities. I thought, well, didn't they go to college? Doesn't that mean that they have the right skills? And unfortunately, it wasn't enough. I then went and worked at Google and there was responsible for recruiting again, looking for talent to join their team. But I would hear the same comments. And for months, I would think, how can we create a better solution? This doesn't seem to be working. So I decided to leave Google and to start the Tech Connection. Here, we help candidates think strategically about their first five years of experience by helping them get familiar with the interview process and helping them to become purpose driven candidates.

HubSeq (YC Winter 2022 - Selected for Interview) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XTiN5YzCKA," Hi, my commentator. My name is Jerry and I am the founder of HubSeq. HubSeq is a cloud genomics platform to help biotech labs manage and process their sequencing data. So I've been working in the field of sequencing for 15 years now and I've seen the same problem over and over which is that the process of taking raw sequencing data and generating results is still very slow and manual for labs. So what most labs still do today is they have a team of bioinformatics and data scientists either in-house or outsourced that will download that sequencing data, process it on their laptops, generate results on their laptops using some sort of data notebook and then email those plots of results to their team members or maybe upload the results to Google Drive. So as you can imagine that process is slow, prone to error and not scalable. So we're trying to do it HubSeq is to bring that entire workflow to the cloud. I first pitched this idea in March of this year to some labs, generally lots of interest. I also pitched the idea to Jared Friedman in the last YC batch and he also was very excited about the idea and encouraged me to try to work on it full time. So lo and behold, I quit my job in May and started HubSeq full time in June. And since then I've worked hard to build out the product, actually launched the product last week. I also got three part-time team members on board to help me out. And also have one lab customer who's paying me $1,000 a month. So the next phase is just to find more early labs to commit to using the product, to iterate on the features and hopefully get a full time founding team to really accelerate the growth of HubSeq. So I decided to be a part of YC this coming batch. Thank you."
TiiMo YC Summer 2021 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_Ba6Yhy0YI," Hi, Timo is a B2B marketplace, provides the best deals to SMEs directly from producers around the world with ease of mind. SMEs rely on wholesalers to purchase products since they lack necessary size and capabilities to buy in large quantities from producers and bringing to the sales location. Locally wholesalers fill the gap but in limited and expensive manner. A tentative SMEs can buy from Alibaba but only fraction of SMEs can manage to do that due to limited purchasing power and difficult processes like shipment and customs. So we will aggregate SMEs purchasing power to skip wholesalers and directly buy from producers for much lower prices and deliver to their preferred locations. SMEs will have access to a larger selection of products and will use finance solutions like credit cards and commercial credit cards. I have five years of management consulting experience on sales channels and commercial excellence around the world and one year as manager in Turkish fastest-growing e-commerce scale-up Gitter. I worked as a senior manager for Mastercard Advisors and many several multinational projects in different countries, including developing solutions for large e-commerce players in the region."
Suggestr YC Application — Founder video (upd: Accepted!),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBhAJwgTlZ4," Hi, I'm Aditya and I'm the business co-founder of Suggestor. I do marketing, I do sales, I work really closely with our customers, including doing all of customer support. At this point, I've been in the recommendation space for almost two years. Hi, I'm Olexi, I'm Ayari Soshir from Facebook. I'm co-founder and CTO Head Suggestor doing all the product and tech stuff. We both move to Singapore to build Suggestor together. Awesome. Now here's the thing. Large platforms like Amazon generate anywhere from 25 to 30% of their total sales for product recommendations. But for smaller brands, this figure is often in the 47% range. This represents a huge lost revenue opportunity. Yeah, you've got to surprise. If you go to random Shopify store today, almost all recommendations you'll see are from the same outdated algorithm from 1992 called Collaborative Healtring. And even for expensive short-watched apps, they still use the same scene. And we see that in 2021, this is just insane. It's not how it should work. Exactly. We use a new technology called multi-modal AI, which actually looks at the products and that's how we make recommendations. Our solution works for small stores, large stores, and pretty much everything in between. Yeah, we just recently launched an Shopify App Store, which is a straight-up. Since then, we onboarded 17 D2C brands and for them, which generated more than $7,000 of additional sales just from recommendations. Thank you. We are suggested and we look forward to telling you guys more about the business that we're building."
Shovel (YC Summer 2022) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXJBaOQfRnc," Hi, my name is A.J. Davidson. I'm Ben Street. We're shovel solutions and we're based out of Oxford, Mississippi. We have a software product that we call shovel and we built the digital marketplace and logistics platform for the pre-construction and dirt paddling industries. In this industry, it has three categories. Pit, a trucker, and a job site, and it all revolves around a load count. Very rarely does a pit, trucker and a job site all have the same number or load count. So what we're doing is we're taking all data and we're connecting all three, allowing people to prove what that did or did not do. Being paid is also a problem in this industry. We're allowing them to be paid electronically upon finishing a job. At the end of the day, shovel triangulates, automates, and GPS locates the process from end to end. In the past year, we've completely built our software, launched our website, raised capital, and received $100,000 business, see fun loan from the state of Mississippi, and we're set to launch at the beginning of April 2022. We're looking forward to what the rest of 2022 holds for us, and we look forward to competing in Y-con there. Thank you."

BooBooway is the Uber for Dog owners. We're an on-demand marketplace that connects dog owners with professionals such as Vets, Vets, and students for pet-setting services. The current solutions out there have a lack of proper vetting and thousands of horror stories of stolen and abused dogs. And this is why we created BooBooway, a safe and trustworthy marketplace for dog owners. The skin's an opportunity for dog owners to find credible and trusted pet-setters while also giving up with community for veterinary professionals to provide additional services. Over the last two weeks we have done 73 customer interviews and acquired 31 customer signups on our wait list. With the rise of dog ownership and dog loving communities we are hoping to create a valuable marketplace where dog owners can find trusted pet-setters. Thanks for your time YC and we hope to see you in California. Before we forget you're our two biggest supporters. Say hi. Bentley say hi."

So first we identified as a problem through personal experience and through our friends social media posts in which they were asked questions like how do I get from industry A to industry C or how do I learn new skills in which to work through any industry. And we noticed that there just wasn't a solution that targeted our demographic. A Google search wasn't enough and we wanted to make sure that there was a tool out there for people to use. And so now we want to be the number one website when it comes to minority professional development. So please accept us as a white commentator so we can continue to provide access across underserved communities at an even larger scale. We even have a model, Hughes, we got you. See you soon."
YC Application abbri.co Winter 2022,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzWWZ59QtH0," Hi guys, I'm Camille Regen this year. I'm on the road to closing more than $2 million in real estate transactions in Colombia. One of the reasons I'm creating Arbita Tio is to have realtors like my father who has a really hard time understanding technology and online marketing. It is also well known that not only in Colombia but in Latin America, real estate market is not regulated and because of that anyone can be a realtor. That breaks a real issue for the industry. So we're working with the top 1% of realtors in the country and we're developing the technology and the partnerships to help them close more deals in 90% less time. I'm sure getting into YC will give me access to valuable knowledge that will let us build essential skills to achieve our vision. Thank you."

CircledIn (YC S22) - Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZU7IUqNRwg," Hi I'm Dan and I'm Ryan and we're the co-founders of Circle Van. We're building a marketplace that revolves around the sharing economy for strangers to group together to cut their cell phone bill by 50%. The problem is the average cell phone bill in America is $70 for a single line plan. If you group together that same exact plan can go as low as $35, a 50% savings. Users are already grouping together whether it's on Reddit, friends of friends with their roommates but the problem is there's no trusted platforms to facilitate the entire onboarding process and the payment process. We streamline the entire process from activations, shipments, payments and verifications. Instead of spending hours in-store awaiting on hold over the phone, consumers are able to save time and avoid headaches by using our platform. So we've completed our MVP, we've launched Circle Van, we've locked in our pre-seed round, we're growing and we're looking to expand into other products and services and we're ready to scale this even faster. Looking forward to seeing you. Thank you."

Podpal + Y Combinator YC S24 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgH-2UFRm6E," Hi, I'm Aaron. I'm not your average engineer. Prior to becoming a technology leader at Microsoft, I designed Scotch-Prippers, built airplanes, and play college football. Hi, I'm Keith. I'm a seasoned front-end designer and marketer with a proven track record at leading Ed Tech and Entertainment Brands. I'm also a podcast host. Hey, I'm Taiki. I'm a graduate student at Georgia Tech specializing in AI. I also lead back in marketing automation teams at NLCHAM. There are over 120 million podcasts in YouTube creators, but 95% of them struggle with audience growth, brand awareness, and monetization. Audio and video podcasters use more than eight apps and spend upwards of 12 hours producing a single episode. This approach is inefficient and ultimately drives many creators to quit, others to outsource and most to drink. HotPow is the fastest way to a million subscribers. Our tech removes the busy works so creators can focus on what they really love to do, telling stories, interviewing guests, and building their brand. Today, users enjoy features like episode planning and team collaboration. Tomorrow, they'll create a scale using our guest portal and AI-powered marketing tools. To have a successful podcast, you need a successful process. We're reapplying because this is a big problem and we want to solve it with you. So join us and become a podcaster's best friend."

I also graduated from Cornell and I currently work in growth marketing for BCG digital ventures. And I've previously worked in growth roles for startups like Verb Energy and Jet. So while reflecting all my early education experiences, I noted that my education within the English department consisted mainly of spark notes and anxiety. I looked further into this and found that this problem isn't unique to me. There's an issue in the US called the decline by nine, where by nine years of age, students stop reading for fun. So with this problem in mind, at the end of last year, we decided to go have conversations and interviews with various teachers, parents and principals. And after these conversations, we decided to found an immersion and e-learning platform that focuses on gamifying actual books to make read more interesting. We developed a beta product, which we just briefly launched the App Store. And with only two posts on next door, have already gained a bunch of users that were using to grow the core user base, as well as refine the product. And we think we're on to something really special and we would love to be a part of YC. So pick us."

Salute is a web-based platform that connects wedding planners to engaged couples through a subscription service. So we're really excited to be able to introduce this unheard concept of affordability in the wedding industry. Through our extensive customer discovery, we've learned there's a whopping 1.8 million couples in the USA every year that forego hiring a planner because it doesn't fit in the budget. And of those couples, they usually seek advice from friends and family, and when most those friends and family have only ever planned one wedding. So so far, in the past few months, we've been accepted into a grant program through the Ross School of Business, and we've also developed a mid-fidelity prototype and received feedback from over 80 users. So we're really excited to join you this summer to accelerate our business and transform the way couples plan their weddings all over the world. Salute!"

So we're building SideGun, a technical learning platform in marketplace, built right into the most common development environments. It's like Coursera, integrated right into a co-editor. As a team, we've been working together for four plus years, building various businesses and products. And this led us to build Flutter bricks, a Flutter UI component library that we built and was revenue generating. We also integrated this into VS Code, and found that many of the beginners on our platform loved the fact that they could draw inspiration without having to constantly switch back and forth between an online tutorial and their editor. This made us think maybe we could solve their problem better with the integrated tutorial. So we'll go to SideGun. And over the last of six weeks, our MVP platform and pilot Cours have already generated over 160 sales and $7,000 in revenue. If you're ready to take SideGun to the next level with YC. Thank you.

We're founding district and district is a platform to manage a distribution of the cannabis marketplace. So basically there's a martial law that passed in California in 2016 that is going to take place in 2018. And it's going to make the marijuana industry follow the alcohol industries model. And we're going to make the software that helps manage all the logistics of that and helps go from the current unregulated marketplace, which is basically just guys growing weed and driving it to spend the industries into a much more regulated structured system. Yeah, and so right now we're working about with about five distributors and we're actually meeting one later on today. So our plan is to help these distributors to onboard their existing dispensaries cultivator as well as manufacturers and to help them really refine this logistic process. And once we refine the process, we're going for the bigger distributors and help them scale better as well as integrating with their existing tools that they're using. I think that's about it.

Our goal was to create a tool where developers and event marketers could collaborate and create compelling digital event experiences using our 100% open and very striped like API. We compare the functionality of our platform to a combination of event bright and square space. We've seen many times what happens when you get people assembled in a room together. In our increasingly digital world, those opportunities can be the basis of a great idea, a new company, or something that changes someone's life. We want to provide companies a better tool to help them organize and execute events to inspire the next generation of leaders. We have all of our resources into this. Money, time, talent, love, tears. We see huge potential in it and we hope you do too. Thank you for listening to our idea and we hope to join you for the winter session of Y-Combinator."

Specifically, they can validate their idea that they need to be taught to their users and launch their own page all in one single way. Additionally, we've been working closely with your accelerators to provide the users with the set of relevant programs they can apply to very easily using their own path data. Thanks to that, we've generated $5,000 of B2B revenue in the last couple of months and we generate even more. So far, we have a company that has a company that released the data version and we're applying to one scene because we strongly believe that you can help us grow our business and connect us to our main market signal and other instances.

Hello Bustani's Application Video  for YC Summer 2022,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnofPp4He9g," Hain, my name is Gala, co-founder and CEO of a Love Boostani. Hain, my name is Rosmoyingi, CEO and co-founder of a Love Boostani. Love Boostani provides access to quality and affordable food. Despite Africa having 25% of the world's Arab land, an estimate of 650 million people lack economical or physical access to sufficient foods to meet their minimum daily needs. This is considering that 60% of African population are farmers. This is from use of poor farming methods and poor food distribution. Our aim is to provide better farming techniques by turning farmers and provision of farming materials such as seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. We will also offer food distribution that's reducing food wastage and lower increases. This will alternatively create a market venue for farmers. We help from our competitor. We believe we can eradicate food insecurity in Africa. We look forward to working with you."
TripUnico YC Application Video for S2023 | Y Combinator Summer 2023,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgaWEdO-HvI," Hello everyone, this is Chimedi Spandey, CEO and founder of Trip Unico. I am currently a software engineer at Amazon working there for more than 5 years and I have been working on the idea of Trip Unico in my part time. This idea came into existence when I was planning a trip to a new city and I had to visit multiple websites just to get the top places I need to visit, restaurants I need to eat up my favorite cuisine or even how to discover local culture. Trip Unico is an AI-driven algorithm which takes into account different factors such as users preferences, budget, time, distance between two locations, credible reviews of Google Yelp and then making a more accurate and efficient activity. It also gives ability to users to upload short videos of the locations and we will have a location profile so that users can go and explore all related videos to a particular location. We are also planning to collaborate with travel partners such as airlines, hotels and restaurants so that we can provide more personalized services to travel offers based on what users prefer. Thank you."

Well, briefly speaking, Forsyth Academy is an educational social network and community for countries to create it. To help them become an infant streaming or gaming, make their hobby deliver to perfection and emotions in case of success or for amount of money.

ignation YC Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXB9E0ejIWo," Hello, I'm Combinator. I'm Josh McBrown, proud non-technical co-founder of Ignation. I'm Peter Luce, proud technical co-founder of Ignation. So Peter and I are mad at a startup weekend and we just got done competing again at one this last weekend. We're a little under the weather. Peter and I have been talking about what to do for our startup. We want to solve a personal pain point for us. As new entrepreneurs, we need to find how to get from point A to point Z. But we don't really know how to do that because we're new entrepreneurs. So we need mentorship and that's where Ignation comes at. We're building a web and mobile base CRM platform for mentors. It allows users to register with our site and import one or more of their social networks where they can indicate one or more people and their social networks who they regard as mentor or mentee. We then go to work and analyze their various social networks and find the intersections or the exceptions between those two groups. So this data is going to be provided in a beautiful info graphic that's going to give mentors and mentees a clear picture of who are effective mentors where they could maybe find improvement and then also to pair the right mentors with the right mentees. We're going to monetize this through traditional subscription as a service for mentors and mentees. We're going to give the product away to groups that need it like students, professors on campus, nonprofits, charities, stuff like that. And they're going to help us get to our last and final way of monetizing by helping drag Ignation into the corporate mentorship market. As the students graduate or the charity workers, volunteer workers go back to work. So we are in Mation and we hope to hear from you. Thanks. Appreciate it."

Glassbreakers YC Application W15,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjwVCoeIcFM," Hi, we're Glassbreakers. So Glassbreakers is a gender-gated mentorship community for women. I'm Lauren Mosenthal, head of technology and product and I'm a software engineer that's worked on several all-male teams. Mentorship is what's helped me stay focused on code and move my career forward. I not only want to use this for myself but to help support other Glassbreakers who need help navigating a career path. I'm Eileen Carey. I'm the CEO. I have worked at large multinationals. My whole career in finance and technology and mentorship has been the key to my success, especially mentorship between myself and other women. I grew up in a really feminist household. So the conversation about gender and the workforce has been a part of my every single day and it is something I am super passionate about. Glassbreakers has three parts. Mentor matching, curated content and forums. The heart of the service is a mentor matching which uses an algorithm I built using LinkedIn data to successfully match women based on skill sets, industry experience and location. We've also got an anonymous forum network. So women can crowdsource career advice in the Glassbreakers community. They ask a question and we'll put it into the inbox of women we know can answer it. Those women can do so anonymously, publicly or with a verified tagline like software engineer San Francisco. We think that by putting contacts to anonymous posts we can facilitate some more honest conversations. So let's have numbers. There are one billion women entering the global workforce in the next decade and they're going to go to the internet to get empowered. Since the player landing page in August over a thousand women have signed up for beta purely through word of mouth. So read the rest of our application to learn more and thank you. Thanks."
S18 YCombinator Application Video-  Music Everywhere,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksmfCtHW7hs," Hi, well I come on in there. We're our music everywhere. My name is Yem, the designer. I'm Pawn Engineer and I'm a set the musical director. Our company is a spin-off of Carnegie Mellon University created to fundamentally change how people play music. Learning to play musical instrument is in fact difficult while summer trying to make it easier by even the most conservative estimates for one of every five students who begin playing this year will equip before the year's time. We demonstrated our first ARP and learning sits on over the state and broad. From hundreds of users feedback we figure out that people they don't want to put in a time to learn an instrument so instead of changing their behavior we decided to adapt to it. It is possible with augmented reality by providing a new AR instrument limitation. You just can easily follow along and then play the simplified version of the song which they like without any prior musical knowledge. So as a quick example perhaps you want to be able to play your fiance's favorite song on your wedding day. Music everywhere provides the tool to allow you to do just that instantly. Thank you, Rio, please see you soon."
Y Combinator Winter 2020 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FywuW0nH1Fs," Hi, my name is Peter Goggins. I'm the founder and CEO of Pysis Atlantic and I've developed a commercial fish feed for use in aquaculture operations that can be used as an alternative to the feeds that are currently used on the market today. Most feeds that are used on the market today are made up something called fishmeow, which is ground up in pelletized trashfish like anchovies or sardines, but my feed is different from them in the sense that it's made from vegetable and insect protein constraints. I can be thought of as the impossible burger for fish feed. In that significant for a variety of reasons, it's much better for an environment and it's significantly cheaper for farmers. They can save a lot of money by switching to my feed. Now I know that farmers are looking for a solution like this because I've talked to a lot of them. I've undertaken quite a bit of customer discovery, spoken to many farmers and I know that they're looking for a more sustainable and less expensive source of feed. Now I recently reached my MVP. I just recruited my first user this week so a farmer is currently using my feed right now which is really exciting and I really hope to be able to get in a lot of commoner. I'm really excited by your program and I really love to be able to see you in California. Thank you."

Resonant and the CEO. What reaction does it's a visualized customer service in the lower area to actually contact any company from all around the world and share visual information in real time? The company doesn't even have to have an account with your server that's actually able to get these information. So have you ever had to describe a strange looking color to your pool, to your pool technician, or maybe had a dry up breakdown and had to explain the funny noise that you're hearing to a technician halfway rather than the environment? What's the reaction of all of our to-do is to actually share pictures, small video clips, and follow the little issues having in real time. And what it does for companies is allows them to track and manage that visual intelligence for research and development, for improved communication on their customer, and definitely enhanced or quicker response time. What we believe is the future of customer service needs to move from audio to visual and in order to do that we are allowing the customer rep to be in the living room as its customers. You know, to see an experience in problem real time. So why combinator, we look forward to working with you to take our next. And show you that cool technology that we have. Take us to the next level."
looknforgroup - YC W24 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD7gbuFTW7Y," I see, hi, I am Lawrence. I am the creator of Likinford Group, a social mobile meetup application to help you find things to do with other people. And then started after I graduated my bootcamp during the job search where I never really like doing data structures and algorithms that I prefer to work on our projects. So I wanted to come up with another idea to work on. And so I like doing a lot of things on my own, but sometimes I would like to spontaneously just find other people to do them with. So I tried a lot of the apps that are out there, but they just didn't do it for me. And it really wasn't until I started reading a lot of reviews that are out there for these apps where I was just like, oh boy, it shouldn't be that hard to create a well executed solution. That solves a problem as simple as allowing people to just find things to do with each other. So I especially as these companies have enough resources to do that. But I don't know, it looks like they weren't doing it or they aren't doing it. So that's when I took it upon myself. I couldn't sit back and watch anymore, especially with the skills that I have. And I want to show that you actually can't do this. So I definitely believed that with the help of YC and the resources and the people that come with getting in that I can make it the number one platform to help people find things to do with each other. And much faster. Thank you."

Hey, my name is Nanchi Yvann, I'm a data scientist at the Department of Film Care Finance. And we build Dactic because we face the problem ourselves. For example, I couldn't find answers to my marketing questions online easily. So I had to resort to forums where I wasn't sure if my question was ever going to get answered. What would be the issue started when I work from home again? I couldn't get in touch with my seniors and many of my questions were being answered for a very long time. I have been coding for 10 years now and I've never really asked the question on Stack of Flow. It just said there's a certain amount of uncertainty about the question getting answered or the time will take to get it answered. Having worked in an online blockchain academy I've seen students spend countless hours just finding solutions to small problems. I feel that we can fill that gap and help other companies and individuals ourselves. So to address all these problems we build Dactic and we believe it will be helpful for millions of individuals and professionals around the world. And we're looking forward to hearing from you."

And we're the co-founders of Cell Center. And our product, the Cell Center app, is a scheduling tool that unlike others tries to tackle the problem of personal fulfillment. Instead of trying to squeeze the most amount of productivity out of every second of the day, we try to look at balance and making sure that all the different aspects that people care about in their lives are accounted for in a given time period. And the beauty of what we're creating is that we're not using artificial intelligence in a way that is just taking the time in finding the gaps and being able to plug things in arbitrarily. But instead, we're trying to understand the whole person. Are you a morning person? Do you do high priority things first? Are you the type of person who likes to take breaks throughout the day? All of those things are what we're factoring into the AI itself to be able to help you figure out when you should do it. And we're seeing a lot of excitement already. We've received funding from two different angel investors. We just completed an incubator in the DC area and we're looking to close out this round of funding, which we could use your help for.

Y-Combinator Application 2010,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXbZVzwq6oA," Okay, my name is Jake and my name is Ben. We're with Hermotes, which is a political social networking platform. The problem that Hermotes tries to solve is deeply rooted in the fact that we have two parties which are in this country which are two giant groups of people that are constantly making it difficult for a third party or smaller candidates to like have any say in anything. So what they end up doing is you know telling all of us why one group is right and the other ones wrong or vice versa and that's not really cool so we're trying to solve that problem. And you know I think I think that's where Hermotes comes in you know provides some solutions to all these problems. I mean we allow all of our users they're not allowed any type of party affiliation. I mean when you go on there you don't say I'm Republican I'm Democrat you know it's focused on what you believe not who you represent. Can you handle it? I think the other thing is that you know with the issues anybody on their sites allows to propose an issue and in that issue you have to state the problem and a proposed solution that anyone on that site can support or oppose. So then the entire community ends up saying oh you know here's a problem that I'm familiar with and these are the array of solutions that they've provided. These are the ones I like so you know the best solutions for I still the top. And you actually could start like learning something. And you know hopefully what this will do is make it so I mean anyone can get involved in the politics and it makes it fun for anyone. And you know hopefully that's what we'll do and hopefully we'll see in the Bay Area."

SYNC is an old demand telehealth platform for holistic medicine. A decade ago, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which is an autoimmune disorder. I spent eight years of my life and $150,000 on surgeries and drugs without any improvement on my health. Two years ago, I started working with a holistic doctor. Within six months and spending less than $2,000, I was completely healed. This journey inspired me to promote evidence-based, holistic practices by combining technology and design. We launched our MVP three months ago, right after applying to IC. Since then, we onboarded 19 doctors, and our doctor base has been growing 30% in Vermont. We started a functional medicine community that allowed us to generate early revenue, both from bookings and subscriptions. We now have five team members, and we did all of those by spending less than $5,000. We are now in the process of our first fundraising, and we think that joining IC would help us reach our goal.

Now, Jobfly connects independent workers with short-term jobs. So, who are these independent workers? Whether everywhere. In fact, they're probably even your neighbors. They're babysitters, dog walkers, Uber drivers, weekend carpenters, anybody looking to earn a second income. Now, what makes Jobfly different? Jobfly gives 100% control to the independent worker. They control their wages, their schedules, and their clients. Jobfly does not take a cut of the paycheck. Second, Jobfly provides a place for the independent worker to accumulate references, build a reputation, and hang their shingle. The independent worker is the customer. And third, for job posters, they're over the browse profiles, read references, and confide that they are getting a reliable source of help. Now, this business model and concept does not exist in the marketplace. I am very hopeful to partner with Y Combinator and bring Jobfly to millions of independent workers, and let people take control of their labor, their income, and their lives. The future of independent work is here. Thank you."

Currently have a nice alerting app, looking to expand on that and integrate not every single monitoring solution on the planet, but a couple of the top ones as well as get run deck in there to help with some automated integrated runbook execution from the convenience of an app. When you're at lunch, without having to stress about open up your laptop at lunch or when you're on call, just doing it all from your phone in the app. But you wouldn't want to make that type of decision to run the runbook without having some data to corroborate what you think is going on. So that would be where the integrations of monitoring come into play, as well as integrations with the second product, which is a solid, which is a search tool for as many things as we, I could come up with, but basically everything that is not searchable easily all combined into one easy to search interface. One of the best things that search would be log, so there's definitely that and it's going to be the main use case for enterprise customers, but I do hope to see lots of new found efficiencies come about with this better broadly scoped search capacity that is also fine tuned to whatever anybody's best bookmarking tools are or however they keep their information, make its local text files, maybe it's whatever the case may be, maybe it's their, you know, their ever notes, whatever it is, and maybe it's all of those. They're going to search all of them from one place, save the search results, save your search history, and that will sink the cross devices. Anyway, thank you very much. Jefferson, hey, I'll see you. I take care."
Customary (YC S22) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryW554coDvo," Hi, we're the founding team of customary and automated screen printing marketplace that processes orders through local print shops. I'm Kyle, CEO and head of sales. I've experienced starting a pair of brands from start to finish. And I'm Krem. I'm the lead developer. I work in risk management and automation. We started customary to rescue our friends from overspending on custom orders such as event t-shirts or company honey's. All the while, they could have saved by supporting a local business who's often better priced than the large staple of power printing websites. Yeah, and we've actually spoken of both ends of our business, so both customers and print shops. And print shops that usually lack an easy use, you know, web interface. And they also want more online visibility. And customers, they want to alleviate the whole pressure and headaches of going through the order process at the local shop. You have to call them up. You have to deal with so many different people and manual processes. And they also want to save some money on the way as well. Yeah, we've automated and introduced a super easy to use user interface. We've also implemented our ranking algorithm, which ranks shops based on price, proximity and possibility. In Q1 of 2022, we've done 50 orders over 25,000 in revenue and onboarded five shops local to the New York area. Thanks for your consideration. Thank you, YC."

I'm a marketing Timber. Hi, myself, Karthik. I'm a great to control on the product manager. So my family actually been doing business in delivering good for small retailer for a decade. And we observed that small retailer, especially mom in pops up in rural, they cannot ordering goods directly from the manufacturer. Because they mainly buy stuff in small quality. So they have to deal with late delivery, expensive, logistic and many mid domain that increasing the cost of ordering on top of that, the counterfeits good is very big challenge for them. They cannot control the quality. So that why we build a line. Before building out in and we have spent weeks traveling across Mekong Delta area to fire how big was the problem, what we learned was clear. The further away from big cities, the more middlemen are involved in a supply chain driving up costs. So rural retailers are in urgent need for more direct cost effective way to get the products. So we come back building our Allen dot com, I be to be ecommerce platforms. We use group community group buying to group retailers based on the location, connect them directly with manufacturers, removing middle man's and saving costs. So launching just three months ago, without spending a single dollar on marketing, we've already onboard 100 paying customers and generates it nearly $5,000 in revenue. Traditional supply chains are outdated, expensive and inefficient. Our solution makes procurement smarter, faster and more cost effective. Let's build the future of B2B retailers together through Aladdin. Thank you."
UnityTree (YC S2015) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAzK-vAi1yc," Hey, my name is Harshah, and I'm a current student at UCSD majoring in computer science. Hi, my name is Heyman Tucker, and I'm a software engineer with five years of experience, and currently a part-time student at UCLA Anderson School of Management. And what are the founders of UniTree? So we saw that current social networking apps used hashtags or tags, ineffectively. We also saw that these networking apps allowed users to enter their relationships, but these relationships were never really used for communication. So we saw this flaw that social networking apps had, and that's when we decided to build UniTree. Now with UniTree, users can build their tree by giving their connections unique relationship tags that identify as how they relate to that person. This can be tags such as brother, sister, mother, father, or even custom tags such as roommates or basketball friends. You know, once you have built your tree based off those relationships, you can use those to effectively communicate to them by filtering on those branches. Now by doing that, UniTree is able to fill the gap that current social networking apps have. We released a beta version of this app to our friends and family, and we have seen the effectiveness that they have had with communicating with their network. We thank you for listening to our patient and we hope to hear from you soon. Thank you."

One year ago, me and my friend were down on a computer application but they had which transferred file between two laptops while listening. But later, over 19 pandemic happened and we were unable to proceed with that further. Then I went to Jatin and discussed about the search in the social media market during lockdown. While lockdown, what we saw that a lot of people were coming online and were posting a lot of unique stuff. A person was a bank manager, now is an online chef and all the content he posted was going viral. That was the first time in the idea of social media website, Saka Mind. After that, we conducted our first survey where Google Forms where we asked few simple questions about social media and then we met college and school-way students and we realized that there were only two problems. The first problem was of privacy of data and the second problem was of reach for the content creators. To solve this problem, we came up with a product called station. Where data will be arranged in communities like technology, dance, music, etc. These communities will be provided by us and we will run some algorithms so that the content creators can maximize their reach and can show their talent to the entire world. To ensure privacy, we are looking for three options. We are looking for open source, or blockchain or a mixture of both. We have prepared a basic product type with basic framework. That's it. Thank you."

Y Combinator Winter 2013 Application Part 1 - Tobias and Vittorio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gw9pty0lDo," Hey, I'm Tobias, this is BitBoyer and later on you will see three directly from Boston. We're playing with our idea AwesomeRumay.com. Let me give you an idea of how we came up with that. Basically, I moved to the US a few years ago and I was looking for an apartment and it was quite difficult to find something because we got a website here in Germany for rooms and find roommates. Which pretty much worked very well. I was, you know, ending up using Craigslist and it was just dreadful. Send out 200 applications and got almost no serious replies. So, luckily I actually got an apartment to Americans but it was pretty much my only shot. So I moved to Boston and I was thinking about this idea all along. So I conducted some market research. I talked to landlords, tenants, real estate agents. Just to understand better the economics of what drives people, what are the suitable years, maybe legal considerations, something which might be different in US. And the more I did that, the more I realized this is really a credible idea. You know, it's a market niche. And there were two striking moments I want to tell you about. There was this one moment where we were sitting down down at the Bordescaffee and there was this couple right next to us. You know, they were looking for a sublet during the summer in Boston. And I saw a talking to them and basically they, you know, they looked for an apartment the whole two hours. And I think they didn't even find something, you know, that they complained about and how dreadful it was as well. And this really convinced my theory that it's very inefficient and it would help so many people creating a website like this. And the second striking moment was when I walked out of the library and that was this girl I overheard to talking. And it confirmed what I was thinking all along. She was saying, I'm an engineer, just moved out of the dorms living with a psychology and business student for the first time. And it's just terrible. Our shadows, they just don't match our, we don't really get along. And I really want to live with engineers, takes you for several reasons. And you know, this confirmed what I was thinking all along. How cool would it be if you had a social search pattern and actually changed the way people look for apartments, you know, roommates by not anymore, but classical terms as price location and quality to whom can I live with. You know, like, I want to live with a guy from Harvard, MIT, BU, who studies biology, undergrad, and they would just pop up on a map, Harvard, MIT, Cambridge, Huntington, and Boston. And you could just send, approach those people. This would be a game changer, in my opinion. Yeah, yeah, it's still, it's crazy that you're using Craigslist in the US for finding roommates. Well, basically we have this platform and it works perfectly and we all use it to find roommates. And when you told me about your idea, I was all in from the beginning because that's really something people need. You know, I mean, that's really, if you're looking for a roommate, you have to use Craigslist. Well, I wouldn't want to do that. And, Carcassus. Yeah, well, basically I have some startup experience. I used to work at a fashion e-commerce startup, so I know some of the obstacles you have to go through. But I think we really can do it. And we're so looking forward to moving to the US, San Francisco. And I think, in my opinion, Silicon Valley is the perfect place to start your business off, especially business like this. So yeah. Yeah, I know we're not the typical farmers for a startup like this. We both have a business background. But I believe this is not a startup, which is all about the technique and the programming and the coding, like, startup as drop-offs, which you also finance. We believe this is an idea which also needs to be out in the road, you know, brought to people, helped it start off. And so, yeah. Yeah, it will be great. Well, let's see. It's really awesome weather in Boston."

My name is Danny and this is Peter and we are two Apple engineers bringing you Project Urge, which is really tackling two problem statements. The first one is the movie recommendations problem and the next one is the movie management problem and what that really means is every time you tell your best friend to watch your favorite movie and they never watch it because it gets lost in the shop floor they forget and then they end up spending forever looking on Netflix and then settling on a TV show they've watched forever. So we're really going to hone in and try and do that on this app but also recognizing that it doesn't stop there and also can stem to TV shows and music and food. Yes, most importantly food. Right now we only have a small prototype but this is a problem that we want to be solved and we think a lot of people want this problem solved too and so we pooled together our money and planned to work on this for a year but we hope that you guys accept us because we think it will go a long way in accelerating our path to success.

Favour-YC W21 | Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLBWP-lKGAg," Hi there, this is Steve from Maydhan and in the adjoining panels we have Ritik, Vishwas and Chalab. We are currently trying to build a platform where we could connect someone who is in need of a favor to someone who could help them out. So our ultimate goal is to create a community where people help each other. I wanted to do some work since we couldn't do it ourselves at that time. Like shopping for daily need items or like borrowing of stuff such as a spare phone or formal shoe or something. We relied on what's up shethis for help from a tradition but most of the time we couldn't find someone who could help us out. So we thought up an idea which would connect communities that people would be able to find someone who could help them out. Here people offering payers would also be able to reward points for helping others. Currently we have started that testing of our concept into societies. The 17 families are on board. We believe that vice he can help us shape our idea and take us a step closer to the dream company we want to create. Thank you."

So here at StudyE, my brother and I on a mission to change the way students and researchers study and research. So a huge problem I face and I know a lot of people face is being bombarded with far too much information. It's just leads to boredom fatigue and being burnt out. Whether you're working on a research part to just study it in general. StudyE is a one-based solution that allows users to summarize data such as text, PDFs, images, and URLs while returning notes and key insight. And with increasing amounts of data, ability condenses extract key piece of information only becomes more difficult. And even with all this key information and data, the time and difficulty required to parse all this information has made information sharing and understanding really difficult. So we have recently launched and we already had 60 using the first two hours with multiple positive reviews. And we believe that with YC by our side, we will be able to make studying easy and efficient. Thank you!"

Privatech | Y Combinator Video Application | Winter 2021,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oshkWGyolRc," Hi, I'm Dominator. We are the founder of the Privatack. I'm Rosanna. I'm Dulce. I'm Paul. And I'm Shikr. Privatack is a privacy and has technology that is an application for mobile and desktop. Many users do not know that they have privacy right and they don't know how to exercise them. They are eager to get to the content and consequently they possibly opt in to the cookies and privacy notification without knowing the implications. Most people also struggle understanding the language used to describe such privacy policies. In order to tackle this problem, Privatack comes together to provide users with proactive notifications and explainable insights prior to signing up for those services and with the near term goal to provide remediation strategies in order to enhance the users understanding. They are by leading to more control over their privacy rights. In recent years, consumers are becoming ever more aware of their private and sensitive data. A billion dollar industry has been grown up around this where companies like OneTrust, Big ID and Trust start now enable those who maintain private data to control it. So, if consumer wants to exercise the rights they can, however, the consumer does not know where their data is gone as they go through their day and supply private information and do other activity. They don't know where they've been, what their rights are. We empower that side of that industry and this is the value that we provide to the consumer base. I hope you accept our application to my combinator. Thank you for viewing. Bye."

And we are working to make phone ordering effortless for restaurants with high accuracy AI-powered voice agents. In conversations with restaurant owners, we learned that managing phone orders were running a busy kitchen, often leads to miss calls, lost revenue and frustrated stuff. Current automated solutions don't fully address this. They are the lack accuracy or are too complex to implement effectively. To smartgate changes that, our voice agent is built specifically for restaurant needs. Accurately processing orders from even the most complex menus. We've optimized it to reduce missed calls and improve order accuracy. We are making it an invaluable tool for busy restaurants. Building smartgate hasn't been easy. We encountered challenges with response accuracy and order flow. But through extensive testing, we find to know prompts and backend system to improve performance. After running tests with around 50 people on complex menus, we're seeing strong and reliable results. This approach has resonated with restaurant owners and so far, each restaurant has signed letters of intent. And we are creating a robust testing framework to ensure smartgate is reliable for each unique setup. We are excited by the potential to transform phone ordering in restaurant industry and would love to have the opportunity to join YC.

According to my QC report in 2018, while insurance penetration is still very low in Africa, your protection gap in other countries is better, with better penetration rates is alarming. It gap between the amounts of insurance that is needed and both is wide, because of the fundamental flow in the business model of the insurance industry. The inability to effectively match supply with its demand. The insurance sector is fragmented and inefficient. Product are expensive and you don't have to consume us.

This is our second YC application. Our journey began a year ago, with the YI-powered sales tools. Both our YC interview were realized that the space was oversaturated and limited our growth potential. Suddenly, an opportunity arose. All of HSO, the first US certified 100% robotic kitchen truck, approached us to develop voice AI ordering agents. After consulting with our early adopters and advisors, we pivoted to become the first voice AI unicorn for the rapidly growing autonomous dining sector.

One in 10 storefronts are vegan, but at the same time there are millions of businesses that can't afford the high cost of a lease. To solve this disconnect or platform-enabled sharing, kind of like what we work does for scrappy companies that need office space. And we've perfected the model. We basically take over and do retail space at a discount, slice it up and sell it off in sections. It's merely impossible to find retail space. It's both cheap and turquoise. So we're seeing 84% of vendors rebook with us, and on average one vendor refers another three. We've grown up tons of twice a fellowship. We've actually doubled our revenue every single month since the program ended. We've seen a registered merchants go from just 20 to over 5,000.

We ourselves build a lot of useless software, especially that guy. Jococide, we believe that product-teens travel, look at the lack of good engineers of good designers, but mostly because they lack good product management skillset. And some people think that the problem is JIRA. We believe that the problem is much broader and to head product-teens we need to rethink product management from the ground up. So we're not replacing JIRA, no. We're replacing JIRA product-borne and confidence. We've already made it to ten active teams in Cycle, and we can't wait to get to Cardiapranya to get 100 more.

They felt superficial and required external validation. On our own healing journey, we privately built an AI self-inquery tool that helped us heal and grow and our friends, ultimately teaching us what foster human connection. And in the past two months, we've been developing and actually released our first companion app, Lotus AI. And in the past two weeks of launch, we got six paying customers, over 5,000 minutes talk to Lotus, 400 emotions discovered, and over 200 core beliefs.

Artisan AI Digital Workers | (Accepted!) YC W24 Application - Founder Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlYe-he1knQ," Hi, I'm Jasper and I'm the co-founder and CEO of Autizen. I've always loved building businesses. My first was a candy shop in my bedroom at AJ. And then for the past few years, I've been working with my agency of 15 people to bring new brands to market with startups and huge companies. Hi, my name is Rupert. I'm the co-founder and CTO at Artisan. I have quite a heavy ML history with APSG in Ashford Physics, Winninger at St. Boxford and research at University, California, as well as NASA Space Telescope Science Institute. That has given me about eight and a bit years of AI and my experience at this point and fun fact, I'm against what I called in skateboard. Yeah. And we're creating the first generation of true digital workers that automate job functions from end to end and calling them artisans. So all of the settings and requests can be handled by chatting directly to the agent. So the LLM is really at the core of the product and then it queries the tools in order to automate much of the repetitive tasks and math abuses. So we like to say that while other companies are putting AI into their tasks, we put tasks into AI. Exactly. And our first artisan is called Ava. She automates the entire art balance sales process. You set Ava up with a five minute back and forth conversation. We like to say it's so easy that a 70-year-old who's never had a sales force could set Ava up. And people just love the idea whenever we mention it to someone in sales, they start chasing us to get Bater Access to the product. And the beautiful thing about sales rep is that we can use the sales rep on our behalf as a free employee for potentially eating our end of food. And then we can take the workflow from the sales rep and apply that to the next generation of agents that are then just rapidly scale. Exactly. So we are definitely out of time but we're going to build a $100 billion company with love for YC support on that journey. There you go."
SKOOP (YC S2021) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGt9PjDC3BE," Hi, I'm Josh and I'm also Josh and we are the founders of SCOOP. We first met back in college when we started a business together where we took digital screens, put them on the back of moving bike taxis and we sold enough digital ad space on those screens in exchange for free rides. After two years we sold about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of ad space and gave thousands of free rides around campus. We realized that the problem was really in our ad technology and it was hurting our ability to scale. So we looked to the digital billboard industry for a solution. After we talked to others in the digital billboard space we learned that they too had the same pains as us and about 25 million displays out of the home are quickly turning to digital displays that will also encourage some of the same problems that we had. And the problem is that screen owners don't have a simple e-commerce management system to sell ads directly to advertisers. So we decide to build it and it's called SCOOP signage. Our app can turn any digital screen into a digital billboard and our e-commerce platform makes it easy to sell the digital ad space online. We know that an opportunity to work with Y Combinator can help take our business to the next level. Thank you. Thanks."

Think of this as your chance to tell a compelling story about your startup, but remember, you only have one minute to make your case. Here's how to break down that precious time. Now let's make sure your video looks and sounds professional without needing a Hollywood production budget or literally any equipment or tools other than your smartphone. If you have been following up with the YC batches and the accepted video applications, you'll notice that quality framing and lighting are not that important. In fact, most of the videos look like they have been recorded on a low-end phone camera or just a computer webcam. The only thing you need to focus on here is making sure you keep it short and engaging, but most importantly be yourself. And that's it. Those are the steps to create a standout YC application video. Remember, YC is looking for clarity, passion, and a strong team with a scalable idea. Nail those and you're already ahead of the game.

Rivia (YC W22) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dFcwWt0HVc," Hey Eric here. I'm the CEO with ELF Experience from the Farmer Industry. Hey I'm Thiago, I'm a Cybersecurity Engineering and CityO. My name is Hank, I'm a medical doctor over 15 years for our experience and I'm an Achieve Medical Officer. We gathered six months ago to focus on the problem of biotech data-fibonitation during ongoing clinical trials. And so we built a proof of concept that ultimately takes traction and centralizes everything. But after discussions with Hank and 10 biotechs, we realized problems were much bigger. I'm responsible for overseeing multiple clinical trials, but I'm still faced with countless Excel spreadsheet that require weeks of manual work in order to understand the data. And those systems do not integrate our medical thinking, which makes it easy to miss potential safety issues that puts our patients at harm. Which is exactly why we are building RIDA. So in the natural RIDA is a SaaS application that automatically collects data from the different vendors, integrates it into a signal system and finally offers a user interface to easily explore the data. That's going to allow biotech medics such as Hank and CEOs to understand their medical data much quicker and also more efficiently. Yeah, and since no one's doing this, we're the ones creating a world for biotechs to a better oversight of the 30,000 ongoing clinical trials and see them in valuable time. Thanks for listening."
Update on YC Application (S24),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDES4qCqymk," Today is May 8th. We are currently in Bangkok today, not in Bali anymore. And working from here, so far no update from YC haven't received any email yet. We submitted the application also just one day before the deadline. So yeah, let's see what we're up to. But we closed two new clients, right? Exactly. MRR is going up. Exactly. So in any case, if we get into YC or not, we are producing cash. And yeah, let me show you this workspace here. It's like a condo in Bangkok. We basically occupy this coworking space meeting room for the entire day 24-7. It's really good for getting shit done. There's a 7-Eleven downstairs. We basically live over this 7-Eleven, 24-7. We buy everything there. Food, coffee and so on. And yeah, I can very much encourage you guys to move to Southeast Asia if you want to have a good focus. And just get shit done, live cheaply. But still, like luxurious, this place is pretty nice. It has a 50-meter pool. And yeah, lets you ship and work a comfortably life at the same time. So our goal is to move from high-touch, climbed work, which obviously pays good, but is not really scared of the small-like agency to self-service onboarding. And it's nearly finished. Let me show you a quick glimpse of how it looks at the moment. Hey guys, let me quickly show you what we're working on with full focus right now. We're working on that guided onboarding, basically, which guides our users towards creating their first AI appointment center completely by themselves. That enables us to move away from that high-touch work that we're doing customized for every client towards a self-service and super scalable solution. It's very good stuff we have here. We basically can add some, enter some data about our company. We're set our AI. We enter our landing page. And what it now does is it will scrape your website and the AI will analyze everything under and just create a script from scratch without using anything. Really cool stuff. So basically what we want to prevent is people having to prompt. Like, people don't really know prompting and they don't want to touch it. It's insurance companies and whatever that we work with. So they can just enter any URL and the script will be generated out of that, which is a really, really nice step to decrease friction. Bro, quickly we have to move ahead and create urgency. Create urgency. Because the board will be deleted in 60 minutes if you don't create an account right now. We do that because of security purposes and just keeping your data personal and, you know, deleting anything that shouldn't be there. But let's go ahead and create a free account. Okay, here we go. Now we're in the guided onboarding where we would connect our cadenity as you've seen, I've already done that. Then we go ahead and select the event type that we want to have the appointment center book meetings to. We can give ourselves a test call just to see how the assistant works. Okay, now we say the call is over. And there we go. You can now purchase a subscription for getting call credits. So call minutes every month for your appointment center. We already have a stripe integration right here leading us back to our app. Beautiful. See you in the next video."

YC S22 Application Video - Waigely,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMakiXTmQ3k," I'm Banking. I'm a body co-founder of Way2. Way2 is a brand to provide services and software that allow employees to access their own bridges. It could be daily, it could be weekly, as long as they earn the money they can access it. Employees will often need to great say the financial, the main town and the physical. But over time we've noticed that the financial is often overlooked and this is what Way2 is trying to address. So, currently people try to solve this problem by going to banks to access pay the loans which can be very expensive. People talk to friends and families to borrow money. This would not allow their plan properly and sometimes some people reach out to their bosses for an advance. So in addition to providing access to them which will also provide them with tools that can allow them plan properly actionable guides that will help their cash flow. Let me talk about the team. Reconciliation of two. We made four years ago through our financial and financial system. We got a couple of projects currently with our own business.

So please, we want you to accept us into the YC Summer Program and we can take which needs to be next level and we can also help Canadians with their financial well-being. Thank you."

YC Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuJUBVZXFFM," Hi, I'm Mike. I'm Ray. And we're the co-founders of WoLO. We're on a mission to make work sucked less. Companies in the United States are spending around $97 billion in year on rewards and recognition. Yeah, most of their employees don't even feel appreciated. We can't blame them. Given that most programs look like getting a Chili's gift card at Christmas. Despite this fact, recognition programs have been shown to increase retention by as much as 25%. That's why we built WoLO. WoLO is an employee recognition platform that makes it easy for employers to reward their employees with meaningful experiences from their bucket list. We've been having some really great success lately, and we're excited to let you know that we're launching our first pilot in San Francisco next month with an awesome single-signing company. We've also got a couple more companies lined up when we're hoping to launch by the end of April. Rewarding employees with meaningful experiences is not a fad. It's the future. And that's why we need your help. We want to accelerate our growth and grab market share before the other guys can figure it out. Hope to see you in Silicon Valley. Thanks, Vice-C. Thank you, Vice-C. I think that was pretty good."
Compras YC Application video summer 2020,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po6zV34U3ok," Hi, I'm Tom. My name is James Hebert. I am important to you live from my apartment in New York City and I'm a developer. I wanted to talk to you today about Compress. You can think of it as like offer up or let go but for small business brick and mortar. But from the consumer side, you would kind of be like turning your local city or neighborhood into Amazon.com with the local products that are searchable. What sparked this is that it's kind of strange that in 2020 it's easier to order something from a thousand miles away than it is to see if the store down the block or half a mile away might have it. Which without calling them or walking there physically. The fix is to try to create the easiest inventory tool of all time, which is completely mobile first. And to try to create something that connects local buyers and local sellers in the online shopping age. So we'll have an MVP live by the end of April but we'd really love the chance to accelerate the idea with WACominator. Thank you so much for listening and hope to see you in California."

Mathyogi (YC S2015) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKd6iu9j1Xg," Hi, my name is Rahul Arvushal. I'm Spamal Las Melane and we are the co-founders of methiodin. When meth is being taught, the main focus is on the steps of solving the problem, not the concept behind the problem. For example, let's take long multiplication. Can students only do the steps of long multiplication or do they actually understand the algorithm behind long multiplication? That's why we are redefining the way mathematical are being taught. Mathric applications offers interactive visual platforms that allow us to understand the concept behind the problem beyond the steps of solving the problems. So far, methiod we have is an application on an education platform at Lodo, where we have more than 250 users in past five months. We are growing but we are not growing faster. So please, why a combinator accept us on your summer 2015 program so that we can help students from all over the world master the fundamentals of mathematics. Thank you."

Twos App - YC Application S22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw5IObxW8yQ," Hi, I'm Parker Vanderbilt, CS major and former Google engineer. My name is Joe. I'm a natural born salesman and most recently had a job in private equity. We're the co-founders of twos, the best place to write things down. We all know the benefits of writing things down. Not only does it help you think clearly, but it also helps you easily remember things. But there are also inherent complications with writing things down on paper. You have to carry it with you wherever you go, flip through the pages to find the things you wrote down, and you're going to run out of space. Current digital solutions are hardly better. You have to create a new note for everything you want to remember. They're overly complex and they're unorganized. That is why we're building twos, the first app and website design to help you simply remember things. Since we last applied, we've amassed an amazing group of early adopters who have validated their need and want for a platform like twos. And with YC's help, we can help millions of people stop forgetting things. Thank you and have a happy twos day."

And we're sure that you can help us with this. See you."
ycombinator application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uedMxXzgQT0," Hi, my name is Wally and I'm the founder of UTV Africa. I have three of the co-founders, Nenez and Texas, also lives in Canada and we have David here in Nigeria who is writing his final exams. UTV is an acronym for Yung, original and urban television. It's basically a merger of a few services, your cable TV network, your Netflix, your cinema and of course a live channel. Now the reason why we did this is because companies that do this in the West individually come into Africa, try to use a billion system or a business model that they're used to and it doesn't quite work well within Africa at least it doesn't work for a huge percentage of the population. What we did is we merged all the services into one created a billion system that works well for the huge percentage in Africa. So this is me saying thank you, I think, for the opportunity and looking forward to seeing you in California."

I'm the other co-founder of Idea Machine. Essentially, Idea Machine is a marketplace where creators can submit their best and most creative ideas that are to be funded by brands and ad agencies. We would love it if brands could benefit from a full slate of high quality digital and social influencer content without having to go through the antiquated process that we like to call Hollywood these days. This came about because Brock and I have worked in the influencer space for a couple years and we just find the process for churning out sponsor content so broken for both brands and creators. This new model is going to work because it's creator-centric. The old model is about gatekeepers in a room coming up with ideas that are derivative of TV. The new model is about digital creators that interact with their fans every day and know what they love. And we're excited to bring it to the market."

Nomeo is an online platform and an offline committee that connects digital nomads all around the world. We started roughly around two months ago after realizing there's no platform that allows digital nomads to connect with each other in body. We then realized this problem is actually global. We are focusing on body right now, but we're gradually expanding to other countries because a lot of our users were asking for something similar like Nomeo and other destinations after they left body. Until now we have 4000 profiles created on the site. 900 meetups hosted by us and other approved hosts with a total of 12,000 attendees to those meetups. We also busy implementing a new system that will allow approved hosts to host paid meetups where we will take commission. We will also empower them to run their own communities through Nomeo. More and more people are starting to travel long-term and working remotely every year. And we are the best digital nomad community existing out there and we are also in the best position to find product market fit so we can truly connect digital nomads all around the world. We'd like to be guided by YC to achieve our goals."

Politics is an operational management system for pet rescues and pet shelters to help them save more lives. With politics, pet rescues can centralize their information. They can collaborate with each other easier. They can automate their repetitive tasks and they can even use their own data to save more lives. Animal welfare organizations around the world struggle to be effective because of these bottlenecks. We started five months ago after winning a pitch competition and since we've raised over $105,000, we've 70 beta organizations signed up and are planning to fully roll out November 1st. I know the ins and out of this problem because I've been deep in animal rescue for more than half of my life. I tried other solutions but they just didn't account for all the crap that was happening offline. Between follow-ups, government compliance, progress tracking and a lot more, I barely had time to even save animals. And I'm passionate about applying technology for good and that's what the perfect team to solve this problem. See you in California!"

Workchek (YC W22) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOG5eaMTr60," Hi guys, I am DeRanjil and I am Ambishik. We are co-founders of Workcheck. So Workcheck is a centralized digitized verification platform designed for employers. With many different size companies across the globe, the big scale companies have a decentralized platform where your employment verification of your employers have been digitized and small size companies cannot afford such resources. Hence we came up with the idea of Workcheck which centralizes the employment records of the employees. It might be for the big size companies and the small size companies and can be accessed globally. So we can think of Workcheck as one centralized database where all the employers are verifying the documentation of prospective employees and this quick can easily access the bill to all. So we make verification very very simple. Thank you. Thank you."
Securable (YC S20) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEOpbEFZGaw," Hey, I'm Alex, I'm the founder of Securable. Securable is an online secured loan lender, and perhaps the best way to think of us as an alternative to a pawn shop. And I'm sure when you're either words pawn shop, you're probably thinking of pawn stars and the buying and selling of old gold coins or sports memorabilia, but in reality, pawn shops earn a majority of their revenue through collateral-based lending, where a loan is extended based on the value of a personal asset, say a watch or a diamond ring. And despite pawn loans being reasonably affordable for consumers and available to those with bad or no credit at all, they provide a really poor user experience. You have to travel to a CD pawn shop to transact. The appraisal can vary widely between shops and they don't allow you to build credit. The goal of Securable is to build a more transparent online secured lending process, where consumers can build credit. A little background on me, I'm a solo founder, and I spent the past four years leading product and BD, at another YC back company called Lendee to You."

So we are a health technology company and we provide user friendly solutions to the patient who are suffering from respiratory disorders. So India has about 13% of the global cases from asthma but we have 42% of the global deaths from asthma. So clearly there's a big problem here. We believe the problem is in the diagnosis of respiratory diseases and also poor compliance and underuse of inhaled medications. The solution we are building is to improve the quality of life of a patient. We are focusing on accurate diagnosis as well as monitoring. Where are we yet? Right now we have built the close sensing technology into multiple products and taking the MVP to doctors for their feedback. So we have one granted pattern, we have three provisional patterns. As of right now we are completely bootstuffed and we cannot build fast enough in this way. So we need guidance, we need funding and we need YC. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
Influgrow YC S17 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4qgcuBDUqw," My name is Yehan, I'm the CEO. Hey, my name is Lenin, I'm the CEO. So just last week we were working on the different startup idea for 28 and found in social way to learn subject outside of your discipline, but still we realized it wasn't something user wanted. So we thought of InfluGirl, a micro influencer marketing for the restaurant. So people did this idea because I used to do marketing in my dad's restaurant for many years. And along the way, we learned that restaurants want to market digitally but find the process complicated. And people are posting foot picture all the time on the Instagram. What if they could get paid by the restaurant for posting those pictures? So we just started working on this idea yesterday, right? And today we're filling the YC application with email restaurants and with creator our website. We have also that influence, maximization algorithms from their science projects. Tomorrow we're going to be asking our friends to be our first micro influences. So there's going to be a lot of progress in the next month. So watch out for us on the website. Thank you. Thank you."

So, back in when I was entering university, there was many things I wanted to try on my laptop. For example, some gaming and some simulation stuff. However, my laptop is just not powerful enough for the application. So, we decided to create applications that allow users to hire personal computer from the other remotely. And we want to create the combat power marketplace where people with the lightweight Thing laptop can do whatever they need. And people with powerful can make money for me. So, we have released our prototype for a few months and gaining some restrictions. Both were responsible for the technical side of the product.

YC Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkFv2TXxSyg," Hey, what's up guys, I'm Stephen Corwin. And I'm Joe Conti and we are the co-founders of city grows. So what we're doing is we're bringing government into the digital age by giving people a new way to interact, getting rid of the concept of like forms as like a way to communicate information and replacing it with the streamlined process so that people are trying to get things done, can communicate with the people that they need to be talking to through the entire process, and have access to the information that they need. So in addition to providing this easy to use portal for anybody who needs to go ahead and work with government, and the workflow tool to help make when people have to work with government efficient and effective, we're going to make all that data, both the inputs and the process and the outputs available, VNAPI, so people can have complete transparency into what their government's doing and how effective it is at going ahead and getting the things done that needs to happen for society to be well functioning. Right, we call it out of the box open data. We think it's an awesome buzzword that people really respond to. We have a really big idea and we're about to take a big idea then YC, so we hope we can work with you guys on this. Yeah."
YC application Summer 2023,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiZbJ_kQrmM," Hello everyone, my name is Vladimir and I'm building tools for sales people to write personalized high quality emails on the large scale. It's not enough to use chat GPT to polish your email. You need to use a lot of information available in the internet to learn what is the pain of the customer and how your value proposition, what you're proposing is relevant to it. Again, if you're not solving the pain, if you don't hit on this, you can spend a lot of time in writing these emails, it will not work. So problem number one, you need to scrape to get this information from very structured sources like blog posts, company blog posts, personal blog posts, LinkedIn, something else and aggregate it. And second, to write these emails. Large language models are able these days to do both tasks rather well and I'm trying to build a tool that leveraged this technology to address this problem. Thank you."
Acomodator YC Winter 2023 Application video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HLALLjTFWA," Hi, I see. My name is Hurgun and I'm the co-founder and CEO at a combinator. Hi, I see. I'm Silgun, the co-founder and CEO at a combinator. I'm a book writer. Currently, international students are arriving to a new country to continue their education. The biggest problem that they face is finding a place to live. Right now, there's no way for them to book an affordable and long term place from their home country before they arrive. The only options that they have are to stay at an Airbnb or at a hotel while they look for a place to stay. And this turns out to be very expensive for them. And they don't have a credit score. They don't have a job later. And most landlords are just not willing to entertain them at all. So they have to secure something which is, it does not really quite fit their needs. And they tend to settle for something which is not very good. Because we both been international students ourselves, we came together and built a combinator, an online platform that allows international students to book an affordable and long term place to stay from the comfort of their home country. So far, we've hosted about 13 international students throughout the platform and are expected to generate a revenue of $23,000 this year. Also, we're profitable. Cheers, YC. We hope to see you soon."

Like gig workers, tech workers everywhere in between. And they've all told us some variant of feels like that. It's demoralizing, it's difficult. We think we have a better way to do it. We can fix it. So we have our MVP built. We have our initial paying customers. We just want to work with YC so that we can build faster, scale faster and get bigger faster. There is no doubt in my mind at all that two, three, four years from now. What we're doing now is going to be the way people find their next job. We just want to be the ones to make it happen.

Lapa (YC S2016) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqpSoIBwlp4," Hi, I'm Shunabi, and I'm Zoe, and we're the co-founders of Lapa. As a woman from India, I never really felt safe in the neighborhoods of the city's day. I lived in Rio de Janeiro for a few years, where I used to walk home on really dark and dangerous streets. But I always felt better when there was a food cart out, because they had bright lights and it meant that there were people around in case anything went wrong. We love street food and we also love exploding new neighborhood, and we hate carrying pepper sprays, but most of the places in the cities are really unsafe for us. We decided to farm Lapa because we realized that street vendors contribute to women's safety, and that by mapping their locations, we could help women find the best routes to take. Lapa is really good for street vendors too, by placing them on the maps we give them access to new customers, and it shows policy makers that street vendors have an important role to play in ensuring safer streets. Thank you for watching our video."
Singulution YC Winter 2018 Application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj0IAKXzlqM," Hi, I'm Hunt and I'm CEO of Singillusion. I'm a software engineer with 10 years of experience, most recently with RISP and Networks doing real-time data visualization. Hi, I'm Chris, CLL of Singillusion. I'm a designer with 10 years experience and I'm a sole prior to painting for the design, a firm based in El Paso, Texas. I'm not a mentor to course the last year working out in the same office building. We both noticed that many companies have a variety of applications, creating any efficiencies or redundancies with essential business processes, oftentimes, inter-AV systems and generating real-time information is difficult because of the lack of consolidation. So what Singillusion does is it combines point-of-sale e-commerce and website functionality in one cohesive interface. And this data-first approach gives us a single point of truth that makes it easy to pull real-time meaningful reports from multiple locations, the e-commerce store, and your website. And this gives you a much better idea of how you're doing across the board and gives you a real-time perspective of your business. We hope you share more of the guys out in California. Appreciate it. Thank you."
momo YC S21 Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv7QIGb-yOg," Hey YC, my name is Austin. Hey YC, I'm Sean. And we're the co-founders of Momma. We've both been deep in the personal finance space for the past two years and found that all of the existing resources for opening and managing credit cards are outdated and ineffective. And this is a huge problem, saying 25% of millennials are planning on opening a new credit card in this year. And 60% of people we interviewed just ended up getting a credit card based on a friend and family's recommendation. And then 70% of people we interviewed just got one card and used it for every single transaction. They're missing out on tons of rewards and plenty of opportunities to improve their credit score. So what we're doing is we're building a tool that connects directly to your bank account, shows you exactly which credit card is best for you and how much you can make if you open that credit card. And then where do you use that credit card, along with managing those cards as you have them? We're streamlining the process of getting a new card and managing that card from multiple hours a week to minutes a week. And so we're excited to meet you and hopefully see you soon. We hope to make everyone more money. Bye."

So why am I the right person to launch a platform like this? Well, I'm an avid reader. I love books. I spend way too much time reading. I know all of the bookstores in LA. I currently have too many bookboy friends to count. If you don't know what that is, that's like pre-hashtag team Edward team Jacob. I'm a Hufflepuff. And I just love stories. I've been working in publishing for the past five years and have an ambition and drive to really just want to see content creators like me succeed. I'm an aspiring author myself so I know about the pain points in which authors continue to reach and face. And I think PlotFix can provide them with that insight that they really need to take it to the next step and be able to increase their presence in online book sales. So I'm currently interviewing CTOs and I would love to be considered for YC."

And together we're building a company called St. St. can best be described as a ThitBits for work. So basically it helps you focus and helps you also be less distracted. But then it also challenges you to build healthier and better work habits. So for example, take more breaks, check Facebook, last go home on time, things like that. So we think this is going to be a great tool for all knowledge workers. I hope them improve the quality of their day, but also leave more fulfilling lives. So far we've pre-sold 1000 packages of the software and the hardware and we're shipping them next month, they're in production now. And we've been beta testing the software for over six months. Really good metrics showing up in the last few months. And we've raised $300,000 so far. But you know, you've said it. So I think having a thousand products, ready to ship is great, but we really want to start working towards that goal of reaching all the knowledge workers around the world. And we need some help with that. And we think the best help we could probably imagine getting would be a Y-combinator. So we would be honored and amazed if we can join your program. And we would hope to come from here, Beijing to you in California soon. So thanks for watching and hopefully see you there."

So what we are trying to do is to help people find a place to live outside their original country. And the reason we're doing that is because we see so many people kind of struggling with that, especially in the place where English is not the common language around the area. And there are some problem they face like some agency will just increase the price just because they are from another country and as well as there's some communication issue like language barrier and sometimes even trust issue between the local land or and the tenants. So we build a website and helping people with fine houses and hopefully can mean kind of reduce the gap and help them to get in the place to wherever country they want to live."

Essentially what we do is allow our users to be in multiple places at once by attending their online meetings for them. Since my last application video, a lot of things have changed. First of all, I shaved just time around because I didn't realize the videos get that amount of views, so that was embarrassing. I haven't gotten a haircut yet, but that's a different story. What else? We now have 57,000 users in over 175 different countries, which is incredible. We still have spent less than $400 on marketing. So it's completely unprecedented. Our growth is not normal. And our team has also grown from one to four developers now. Myself included, obviously, which is super exciting. We've got some incredible ideas for how we can maybe pivot the business at the COVID, but that's the biggest reason why we want to be part of YC. So we can take this traction, this team, and this incredible customer base that we have and pivot into something that will be more sustainable after the majority of schools are no longer being hosted online. Anyway, thanks for your consideration."

Generation Conscious (YC W23) Application Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgZZgshdXBc," I'm G.O. Junko. I'm a first-generation Trinidadian Chinese and I grew up near nine waste transfer facilities in Jamaica, Queens, New York City. And as a result I got asthma. I started investigating the waste crisis to better understand my health and to better understand how we got here. And what I found was that 75% of everything we throw away is fast-moving consumer goods. Half of that is food and beverage and the other half of that is personal care of laundry and household cleaning products. So I started interviewing about a hundred students to better understand their zero waste campaigns to ban plastic. But what I found was that nine out of ten of them were still buying personal care and laundry in single-use plastic. All the plastic free options were really expensive and really inaccessible. And that didn't make any sense to me because packaging can make up 9% of the total per unit cost of a good. And that last mile delivery can sometimes be 10-20%. So every refill should technically be about 20% cheaper. However, if you go to a zero waste store, that's just not the case. And so I launched several pilots at universities where they paid up front for all of their students to access our zero waste products for free. 84% of students said that they would actually pay to refill our laundry detergent sheets. And since launching our plastic free refill station for laundry detergent sheets, we've generated over $160,000 from 14 universities and today we have 8,000 students refilling from our machines."

So we built Pukena 12 months ago to connect household and companies to reliable local artists and service professionals here in Lagos. Yes, we launched the 2017. We have the staff for 12 months and we have never really started to complete that. So many jobs for handyman jobs to defend services, to get our services, to training, to grab other equipment and the rest. So since inception 12 months ago, we have been sure to grow at a rate of 30% months on month. We have been able to 10 jobs performed on our platform every week here. Yeah, one major difference here from Pukena is that our site providers are web trained with developed web metrics and then they are in short and the body process involves a lot of work ethics training and so we're higher from most your high quality and restaurant. So we are currently team of six people, comparison of four directors, making of the board of directors and two full-time staff here. So we believe that our web combinator we give the experience that we need to scale off this project and turn it into a global computer. So thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you."
Smile (YC Winter 2021)  application video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY9sVvaoXTA," Hi, my name is Clon. I'm Mulligan. I'm Sally. I'm Yo. And where are the co-founders smile? So smile is a mobile payment app that allows businesses and individuals to save money and accept payments all night. It is also a platform that allows companies such as right-hailing, food delivery, flight to getting all these types of companies to build their app who isn't a smile app in the form of mini-programming telegram ports fast and cheap. So why smile? Generally, in Africa, it is expensive in time consuming to build a mobile app in Ethiopia. It's even worse. That because there is no way of accepting payment all night. That means there is no credit card. There is no international banking. There is no company that provides mobile payment or online payments. So me and Clark had this idea of creating a super app and we were searching for a software developer everywhere. And we couldn't find Amy. Apparently, I was lucky enough that I know Sally and we have been growing up. We grew up together. So we had to do each other. Yeah, next to her. Literally next to each other. He just showed me all the past projects that he had done. And we decided to the MVP then that MVP just made us realize that we can actually do this project. And right now we are two months away from finishing our alpha version. So Clark. So the common question you get is why now? So Ethiopia is going through a lot of change in terms of privatization and policy change. And the government is really eager to move towards a casual society. So for the first time, the private sector is allowed to participate in the mobile money sector. And you know, let us why we're not afraid of international companies coming into the country, but they've actually restricted it so that only Ethiopia can participate in that sector. And even if they were to come into the country, the likes of the Mesa and Ali Pei, they wouldn't understand the Ethiopia population the way to do it. And so we're the only ones making what we're making. And we think that we're under something based on the insights we connect to. Yeah, we have a great chance to create something impactful. They're not the same time. Dominate the second biggest mobile money market in Africa. So I see, please fund us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye."

Basically, Eventify is an event company that makes it easy for the customers to actually go on, customize and order an event to any blank space. I created this because I was an event planner and I had so many customers who knew what they wanted. They just needed someone to execute it. It had me doing the most repetitive work for such fees that were all over the place. I just wanted to simplify the process for myself and be able to service more people at the same time and have happier customers. So, I love this idea. I submitted it a couple of years ago and created something else instead of it with another venture company. But I want to pursue this idea, this is my original idea, and I'm ready to take it all the way. So, thanks."

So I with my two other childhood friends who are also engineers by profession started Mindspace.

Weave's Application Video for YC W14,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyvQJGcQGw," Hi, why combinator my name is Brandon Rodman. I'm the CEO of Weave. My name is Clint Barry. I'm the CTO of Weave. And my name is Jared Rodman. I'm the C O O Weave. At its core, Weave is a telephone company. What makes us different than all the other telephone companies out there is that we link up our telephone service with a small businesses CRM. We also incorporate text messaging and emailing into our system. When somebody calls into a business using our phone system, all of the patient or customer data will pop up automatically on the computer screen and give them multiple opportunities to communicate with those patients to interact with them. It also identifies what they can do on that phone call to generate more revenue. So far we are in the dental community. That's the vertical we chose to start in. We exited a beta in June of this year and we already have 230 paying clients. We're going to eclipse one million in overall revenue for the year. So we're pretty excited. As far as technology goes, we love open source technologies that we've all the way from the communication stack to the software we install on our clients computers. We use open source for everything. Our initial alpha version wasn't very modular, wasn't scalable, but we've changed all that. We reworked the whole system so that we have an extremely scalable modular system and some great development developers here doing agile development, adding features on a weekly basis. Cool.

Virtues is a kind to base social network where people can invite their friends and colleagues to share the best and the worst attributes about them and ask each other's opinions and thoughts about various subjects and topics. Why virtues? Because it has been personally a problem for me when I meet new people to know more about them out of the box and when I google search and stock them and social media it paints pretty inaccurate picture about them to be honest. So I build virtues which lets anyone instantly and very accurately know about a person's character abilities and beliefs validated through his own network. So the platform will be up and running by the second week of April and a little more about me. I'm a full-sang Bembe de Bainabura have been working on quite a few ideas until now and have been freelancing for quite a while. So hope you like it. Thanks for watching. Have a nice day.
MyVu - YC application summer 2018,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gA6_-B0IFw," Hi, my name is Olivia, I'm the CEO and co-founder of CinemaSinema. Hey, my name is Jamori, I'm the CEO and co-founder. We've known each other for 10 years now and have worked on multiple projects together in video production and animation. And we've both discovered that we have a shared passion for both storytelling and cinema. This led us to wanting to create an app called MyView. It is a social media platform dedicated to cinema reviewing and rating. It allows a user to construct their own environment around people with similar tastes and cinema. And through our market research, we identified that people are largely influenced by friends and family when it comes to deciding on a short movie to watch. And our biggest feature is that average score of what your community has rated a short movie along with an IMDB rating and read reviews. With our apps launch coming in summer of 2018, we believe YC can help us push the app to reach its full potential. We hope to see you soon and thank you. Thank you."
